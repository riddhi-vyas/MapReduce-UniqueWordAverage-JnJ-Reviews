2021-07|1.0|Orchid Oil Shampoo|i normally only need to wash my hair every 3 4 days but with this shampoo my hair was greasy after 1 day after about a week of use it caused me to break out in these sore bumps on my scalp i stopped using it and they ve since gone away the consistency is also like jelly and not easy to use worst shampoo i ve used 
2020-08|2.0|Orchid Oil Shampoo|my hair is long thick and dries mostly straight with some wave i do balayage which means a little dryness and damage but overall my hair is pretty healthy this shampoo definitely overstripped my hair which is pretty surprising for something sulfate free goes to show that sulfates aren t the only ingredients that matter in a shampoo formula the smell is ok not my favorite it does linger which is great if you like it left my hair feeling really tangled dry and stiff even after using the matching conditioner which wasn t much better pros affordable lathers well cons too drying doesn t smell that great weird jelly like texture that is hard to squeeze out of the bottle definitely would not use again 
2019-08|4.0|Orchid Oil Shampoo| lathers easily nice smell good for oily hair
2018-08|5.0|Orchid Oil Shampoo|i rarely have good results with using drug store shampoos and conditioners on my fine highlighted humidity sensitive hair a friend raved about this and i saw it at the drugstore buy one 2nd one 50percent off so both shampoo and conditioner together were 12 worth taking a risk it left my hair smooth soft and shiny plus smelling fabulous i will probably alternate with another product but for now it will be a staple in my shower 
2018-08|1.0|Orchid Oil Shampoo|has a light orchid scent this shampoo left my fine dry hair feeling stripped and squeaky clean 
2021-06|4.0|Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity-Blocking Hairspray|if i were to rate this on being a hairspray used to keep my hair in place it would be a 1 5 stars but i m rating this as a hair texturizer and giving it 4 5 stars used this on vacation in puerto rico and initially wasn t sure if it s the mix of beach water and this spray but i had amazing hair texture that have my normally flat sleek hair body and a bit of wave i still use it and can confirm that this still provides grippy texture which the quot anti humidity quot formula helps with doesn t make your hair crunchy or immovable still keeps things soft and flexible even when doused generously over the hair but don t go too crazy 
2021-05|3.0|Charcoal Detox Conditioner|i tried this in conjunction with the matching charcoal shampoo they both smell nice which is great for in the shower after using the shampoo i definitely felt that i needed deep moisture as all shampoos do this seems to have a rich texture but after i rinsed and towel dried my hair my hair felt really stripped i think it s too much for my hair which is very thick and wavy curly i m using up my bottles by sharing with my roommate and occasionally i may use these products if i feel like i need a deep cleanse 
2019-08|4.0|Charcoal Detox Conditioner|i loved the charcoal detox shampoo and used alone initially to see how well it worked i then added in the conditioner to my routine i really like them both the conditioner has that same men s body wash fragrance which might be a deal breaker for some personally i didn t mind as the product itself delivers and i can always use a fragranced hair mist to disguise my masculine smelling hair this conditioner seems to work better when i don t use a generous amount i find a smaller amount of product seems to work better for my hair and leave it less oilier i apply this to the lengths and ends and let it sit for around 5 minutes whilst i get on with my shower results lovely soft hair which although not in the silicone way of feeling soft is more of a natural softness that just feels healthy i wasn t sure if the charcoal in here would interfere with my hair color luckily it doesn t strip or fade the dye if you re oily or looking for a conditioner with decent slip that rinses out easily this is well worth a try selena x my hg list as i ve sampled 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment
2021-04|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i m surprised at all the low reviews for this shampoo i really like it i have very boring hair though so i m not looking for any specific results from my shampoo i just need something that cleans well and smells nice and this fits the bill perfectly it foams up nicely rinses clean and i have no issues with it the bottle also lasts a good long while especially if you have short hair like me it s a really basic shampoo but that s what i like about it no frills the packaging is on the bulky side but eh i can live with that i think ogx as a brand is a little pricey for the drugstore but i would purchase this product again and i d like to explore some more shampoos from ogx too 
2021-02|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|picked this up at the supermarket and my mother told me to put it back as it gave her horrible greasy hair when she used this shampoo back in the day i wanted to try the product myself so i purchased the product made my hair feel so thick and greasy and not exactly the effect you d expect from a moroccan argan oil shampoo my roots especially felt very greasy and this happened every single time i used the shampoo never purchasing again and not bothered to try any more ogx products 
2019-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i enjoy using this shampoo for many reasons it doesn t dry out my hair i have the option to wear my hair wavy without frizz or straight without frizz my ends feel nice not super soft but definitely not dry it s not that expensive amp it s almost always on sale the bigger bottle comes with a pump which is very helpful my scalp is usually very oily most shampoos just make the oil problem worse this does not it s also sold at almost every major store you can even find it at your local grocery store which is also helpful if you run out it doesn t cause me any back acne the scent doesn t bother my allergies where most shampoos do so it s great for those many reasons overall i would rate this shampoo a 4 5 i wouldn t recommend this for someone with dry hair because overtime your hair will dry out even more but normal to oily hair this a great affordable option 
2019-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|the product smells ok but from the first time i used it my scalp itched and burned it just got worse with each use i had to throw it out after using it 3 times
2018-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i wanted to try a shampoo that didn t have sulfates in it but was also reasonably priced and i have also liked some ogx products that i ve tried in the past so i picked this the lather of it is iffy but i think this shampoo cleanses my hair without stripping it too much i think i would buy it again but i ll continue to try other shampoos 
2018-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i only tried this range of hair products for the first time this year and have to say it agrees with my hair my hair is quite dry and many shampoos and leave it feeling even more dry this shampoo smells quite nice i was initially disappointed to find that the lather texture wasn t that great i felt as though i was washing my hair with a conditioner however despite this whenever i use it i find my hair after washing feels lovely and always has a good healthy sheen i have not used another shampoo since 
2018-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this shampoo smells great and left my hair silky and shiny but also caused a terrible allergic reaction i have sensitive skin and immediately felt a burning sensation when i used this shampoo and conditioner i washed them off quickly but still my lips and face swelled up and i had chapped lips and angry red eczema on my neck hands scalp and face for days i would advise that you stay away from this range if you have sensitive skin 
2018-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|my shampoo bottle busted in my suitcase on the road i bought a 3 ounce travel size for 2 50 at walgreens if you buy the full size at 7 for almost 20 ounces that s not a bad price my hair is recovering from some abuse and gets frizzy and dry it has also thinned out recently and has lost a lot of it s luster i need a good moisturizing shampoo that doesn t weigh my hair down or strip it and can remove build up it also needs to smell clean and elegant not like a clown threw up vanilla ice cream on my head this did the job i got many unusual complements on how shiny and soft my hair was the smell is a tad bit sweet but has a musk to it that makes it nice the fragrance didn t last past the next morning it wasn t as moisturizing as my current shampoo but it gave enough i had a little bit of trouble getting a lather but that could of been the water in the area the cap kept leaking after it was closed travelers hate leaking caps or it s just my curse of leaking shampoo overall i ve had the same result with other drugstore shampoos and i don t regret it i might buy a full size if i want to switch up one day 
2018-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|the australian market versions of ogx are like washing your hair in in dish detergent the conditioners are just as bad 
2018-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|hi this is my first review anyways i just washed my hair with the shampoo amp conditioner and i ve got some results my hair is very very thin and gets usually damaged pretty fast anyways i rinsed my hair with water and then i started to use the shampoo i leaved the shampoo in the hair for 2 3 minutes and i rinsed it out with warm water and did the same thing again after the secound wash i actually realized that my hair got sooo soft i rinsed the shampoo out of my hair and started with the conditioner i leaved the conditioner in my hair for 5 minutes and rinsed it also out my hair got softer and also shinier than usually after when my got a little bit more dry i brushed it and i saw wow my hair is super shiny and so soft the smell of the two products are very nice my skin did react to it good like it didn t hurt or something so i recommend this product 
2017-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this brand used to be my go to for sulfate free shampoos and conditioners in the drugstore once i colored my hair it needed a little more tlc but if you have healthy hair this is a great suflate free option it also lathers like regular shampoo which is nice sulfate free has come a long way 
2017-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i used this product twise it couldnot control the frizz but my hair fall became less my hair a silky and soft and it remained like it was but the smell would vanish i do nt know if to use it again or not
2016-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|meh just ok bought for about 7 at target for my 12 year old s long thick slightly dry hair not great and not horrible you must use a good conditioner afterward we did not like the argan conditioner so we tried the coconut milk one not the coconut water one and did not like that either so far i am not impressed with organix 
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i bough this shampoo along with the matching conditioner when it was on offer at superdrug i wanted to get something similar to my moroccanoil repair and i heard good things about this range so i gave it a try it is a ver dense shampoo to the point that it is tricky to squeeze it out and it has a sort of floral smell so at the start i found i a bit weird you don t need a lot but to spread it all over my scalp i tend to diluite it or it is too buttery i have been very impressed with the results my hair is super shiny which i didn t expect it doesn t weigh it down at all and feels quite hydrated mainly thanks to the conditioner overall very please with the range 
2016-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|looking for my receipt so i can return this i bought it along with a cleansing cream shampoo to alternate with when i use that cleansing shampoo my hair feels sooooo good when i use this shampoo my hair is left feeling lifeless with a ton of greasy buildup at first i thought it was because i was washing with warm water that my scalp was producing more oil but seeing the reviews on here i m guessing it s just this product that s causing it 
2016-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|it doesn t clean my fine greasy hair well the next day after using it my scalp is itchy my hair is limp i love coconut water from organix but argan oil seems to be to heavy i m disappointed 
2016-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|my hair is straight with dry ends and prone to greasiness i think my hair was deydrated because when i have used hair oils it seems to get better and the ogx spray in oil was amazing i tried this as it was half price at superdrug but it leaves my hair in such a bad state not only would my hair get greasy faster than normal but it created extra tangles and static to boot it almost felt like that desperate time i washed my hair with shower gel dark times i try not to think about it with dry scratchy ends my boyfriend thinks its great but its a no go for me im afraid 
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this is a good shampoo i have been using high end brand names redken wen and i am impressed with this my hair was not stripped when i washed and the conditioner was good too my hair was soft shiny and stayed clean for a few days i know someone with great hair and the shampoo used to get that gorgeous head of hair that way was organix tea tree mint i will try that one too 
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|background my hair is medium asian straight non virgin prone to breakage and tangles and has scratchy split ends i ve always wanted to try organix shampoos especially the tsubaki one and got my hands on a double sized bottle for 5 the shampoo is very thick and rich it s almost like putting a hair masque on but it s shampoo the smell is very sophisticated too the first time i rinsed it from my hair i could noticeably feel the tangles being washed out with the product lathering up normally puts my hair in knots but not after using this it was instantly soft and smooth in the shower i was hooked from that moment on my hair does require conditioner so i ve been pairing this shampoo with my all time holy grail it s a 10 miracle leave in conditioner and combing out my hair while wet during the daytime my hair is so friggin soft i can t help but twirl it in my fingers all day it s like touching real silk price wise i got it at a good deal i try not to go overboard with spending serious coin on makeup and bath goods this product lives up to its promises though so i don t mind 
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i think argan oil is amazing and i love using it i mainly got influenced from this great review on the product that i found very helpful and i think you should check it out https www mapleholistics com products hair care argan oil shampoo 
2016-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|oily roots dry ends and damaged hair this shampoo didn t do any good i use it daily and leaves my hair in a frizzy decent state was expecting much more for the price if you have my type of hair check the catwalk moisturize oatmeal and honey my hair was really soft back then when i used that stuff 
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this shampoo is organic and very healthy for your hair i was losing my hair and this product saved me great shampoo the after odor is also very refreshing i highly recommend this argan organic oil shampoo you can find it in most drug stores over the counter totally worth it time to treat yourself right also the price is not bad at all 
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i think this is a great shampoo and i love the review when i was doing research i came across this review that was very helpful for me check it out https www mapleholistics com products hair care argan oil shampoo 
2016-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|love smells great thick and rich not watered down like their conditioner counterpart because it s sulfate free you pretty much have to shampoo twice but i don t mind leaves my hair nice price is decent sometimes ulta runs bogo sales 
2016-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|very meh product dried out my hair a little i have oily roots and dry ends my hair is by default decent though it s shiny and i don t get any frizz or split ends and even then i don t really like this it doesn t make my hair soft at all it definitely costs too much for its quality there are shampoos that cost way less and do the same or even better i was looking for a substitute for my eruca shampoo which ran out and i haven t been able to find locally after i moved overseas unfortunately this isn t it i tried the conditioner too and it didn t condition my hair much the ends were still dry the treatment doesn t work that well either i mean i have the kind of hair that s okay without conditioner or treatments and even i feel like it s way inadequate immediately went back to my herbal essences conditioner which is much cheaper and way better luckily i d only gotten the trial sizes though would ve been such a huge waste of money if i got the full sizes 
2016-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|such a disappointment for my hair gave it a 3 because it smells really good it might be good for those who already have nice hair 
2016-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this is a shampoo for people looking for sulphate free its not incredible but i like how it washes my hair and doesn t strip it i am half way through the bottle and its doing me well 
2015-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i am currently using this shampoo i read online that it is sulphate free which is very good for our hair this shampoo really helps to moisturise my very dry and damaged hair chemically treated that i don t even need to use conditioner the price is reasonable too 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|pros used with the conditioner it is amazing leaves hair feeling sooo soft smells amazing cons a bit expensive only sold at some stores i definitely will repurchase this again i ve already been through 4 bottles love this product soo much has saved my hair 
2015-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i want to say i love the organix brand their products are sulfate free paraben free cruelty free they don t test on animals and their packaging is made out of recycled plastic with that being said i hate giving this a bad review but i am only talking about my personal experience i have tried the organix brazilain keratin line then this line it worked for a few months then it made my hair dry and lifeless i switched to the organix coconut milk line and i love it i think organix has so many kinds of shampoos that there is something for everyone i will like to try the other ones but i honestly love the coconut milk one the best you may have a different reaction with the argan oil shampoo and that is fine i m just stating my experience 
2015-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|never thought i d say this about a drugstore shampoo but i love this shampoo cleanses amp moisturizes better than some 30 shampoos that i have tried i use this every other time i shampoo i have dyed blonde hair so i also wash it with ag silver with it s matching conditioner love love love and it goes on sale at shoppers all the time which is great 
2015-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i have been using this product for about 2 months now i will start with pros cons then give my overall review pros it washes well without leaving any build up rinses clean the smell is nice and not overpowering left hair soft silky and no tangles easy to locate in stores cons price of bottle is high for amount of product bottle is a solid color so you can t keep track of product usage overall rating this was a recommendation to take care of my weave extensions i am currently wearing brazilian body wave texture i will say that i like the way that the product works it washes very well with a nice shine and doesn t leave my extensions matted up as i said above the price is a tad too high for the amount of product in the bottle would i recommend yes 
2015-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|after trying the ogx keratin shampoo and conditioner in the pink bottle i thought i would give this one a go at first i loved it it made my hair soft and shiny which it promises to do after a few washes using it i noticed my hair was extremely dry and got greasy way too quick causing me to have to wash my hair every 2 days which made it even more dry i switched back to the keratin one and my problem is gone if you re not a fan of this try the keratin one which also has argan in it and i love it 
2015-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|so here s the thing this product is great on my daughter s thick coarse curly hair but it s horrible on my smooth thick straight hair either that or it just hates my scalp the day after washing it turns my scalp into an oily mess 
2015-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|the consistency of this shampoo is goopy while it does not contain sulfates it contains sodium c14 16 olefin sulfonate which is a harsh detergent and silicones i just do not like the way my hair feels after washing with this when my hair dries it is limp and lifeless 
2015-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i love the organix range the hydrating macadamia oil mask being my hg product curl cream amazing and kukui oil defrzzing scary works wonders too so i thought i would try the renewing moroccan argan oil shampoo amp conditioner for a girl with super tight and long 3c curls i need the hydration and argan oil is awesome for that the packeting is super cute bright and easy to get the desired amount which i is always a plus i went into the chemist and saw a jumbo bottle just for 12aud which is crazy here in aus so i brought it excited to use it when i washed my hair the shampoo tried my hair out which is normal then i conditioned left it in for 5 7 mins which i do with all my conditioners my hair felt soft but nothing amazing so i thought i will just let my hair dry as i normally do as i blew dried my hair as usual using the same products my hair was flat no volume no frizz my curls were loose i was shocked i was so confused how a shampoo and conditioner could do that but i work in a chemist were we sell these products and straight haired ladies swear by this product i would recommend this product if you don t want frizz this defiantly works for frizz i have given this product another go and i let my hair air dry instead and my hair dried like 2c curls 
2015-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i got sucked in by advertising again it s kind of okay i guess i don t feel like it s any better than any other shampoo i ve used but it s so much more expensive the formula is weird and goopy and i find it hard to get it to lather up wouldn t repurchase 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i don t get the bad reviews i used this shampoo and conditioner last night and this morning my hair is so fluffy and clean feeling really soft and bouncy the shampoo lathered a ton and the conditioner has a lot of slip the smell is awesome amp they were b1g1 at rite aid so i only paid 8 for both good deal and a good product i would repurchase 
2015-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this left my hair dry frizzy hard to style and in tangles it didn t lather very well and was very drying to my scalp and the ends of my hair especially to the point that i couldn t brush it out with a wide tooth comb it was horrible and was very pricey i liked the smell and the packaging but the overall product is horrible threw it out and never looked back 
2015-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|nothing special about this shampoo at all smell isn t great dries my ends i like when a shampoo leaves a pleasant hair smell this shampoo and conditioner does not 
2015-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this is probably one of the worst shampoos i ve ever used there is nothing organic about it but that s not the only issue i have with this shampoo it could tell just by the way it lathered it d be drying it has a glue like consistency and took a while to rinse out fully it left my hair a tangly dry and frizzy mess after one use i knew i wouldn t use this shampoo again i bought the conditioner as well but i was so upset with the results from the shampoo i didn t even want to try it thankfully i got the travel sizes from ulta please get the travel size first if you must try this 
2015-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this shampoo ruined my hair it left my hair feeling dry and damaged irritated my scalp just after the first use thrown it away and trying to get my hair back to a healthy condition 
2014-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i don t hate this stuff but by no means do i love it the odd texture of the products gets me every time it s slime like and gunky it does lather up well and has a pleasant texture the problem for me is that my hair feels dry after i rinse this shampoo from my hair i love the way argan oil makes my hair feel but honestly i could not detect it in this shampoo at all my usually greasy hair does feel soft and nourished after using this shampoo with the matching conditioner but it usually only lasts for less then a day by the second day all softness is lost i wouldn t buy this again 
2014-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i used to love this stuff recently however i haven t it dries out my hair and the moisture it does give only last for a few hours i just don t like it like i used to 
2014-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i m sure there s some benefit to this new argan oil craze i m sure it s great for your hair but everything that has argan oil in it smells awful to me it smells like an old man s stinky cologne i used this a couple of times and tried to like it but the smell lingers in my hair forever and made me nauseous i work at a nursing home so i gave it to one of my patients 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|im so surprised this shampoo s rate is low this is the only shampoo that made my frizzy hair soft and easy to manage 
2014-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i got the 50 more bonus bottle 19 5 fl oz of this the conditioner from a local supermarket for 5 99 each my friends looooooove this stuff and i was curious to try it out it s much thicker and more gelatinous than any shampoo that i ve ever used before maybe this consistency is why it doesn t lather nearly as much as other shampoos it s lightly perfumed and it smells wonderful the product promises a sleek sexy shine i have rough dry hair and it made almost no difference other than cleaning it i used both the shampoo and conditioner from this line for about 2 weeks straight and i can say that my hair is in the same condition it was before i started using this line it s mediocre and not that great but it does its job as a shampoo it didn t make my hair shinier or sleek like it said it would i bought it on impulse and because it was 50 more than the usual bottle i may buy it again but there s better shampoos for the price considering that one normal sized bottle is pretty small and quite pricey at almost 6 
2014-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this dried my hair out and tangled it up so bad it smells great and i was excited to use it because actual argan oil was nice on my hair and skin but for some reason this just mummified my hair 
2014-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|update wth why would they re formulate with non natural ingredients inc dimethicone cost perhaps or maybe complaints from people saying they couldn t get a lather it was drying etc just re purchased then noticed the ingredients list has changed i loved using this shampoo in my rotation but my love affair only lasted one bottle oh well i m returning it to boots as their website shows the old ingredients list and i obv won t re purchase unless i can find some old bottles on ebay now i understand some of the negative reviews original review considering argan oil is fairly high up on the ingredients list as well as other natural oils this is a reasonably priced shampoo i m stunned at the negative reviews on this shampoo as i ve had such a positive experience with it so far but i wonder if they re mostly from people whose hair is very dry already as more natural shampoos won t usually do your hair any favours when it comes to moisture even though this one is supposed to give you moisture it probably wouldn t give enough for those hair types anyhow despite being a regular oiler mostly for hair growth recently i ve been finding i need a slightly more moisturising shampoo than i m used to in order to avoid tangles as i grow my hair longer nothing too conditioning just a natural ish shampoo that won t leave my hair squeaky clean just clean i have coloured fine bra strap length hair with a slight wave and i normally do well with mild natural shampoos i don t want sls or anything else colour stripping or dimethicone it contains dimethicone copolyol a water soluble silicone derivative and i don t mind a slight lack of lather which you expect when you leave out sls it s early days but this seems to fit the bill i don t use the matching conditioner as i m happy with my current ones i m not sure i d want to use this one every time i wash as i think i would soon get buildup at my oily roots but as it doesn t make my fine hair a stringy mess or overload it i m pleased btw the texture really reminds me of faith in nature jojoba shampoo for dry hair i gave up on that really quickly about a year ago as i don t think i understood you have to emulsify it with water in your hand to get a lather before working it into your hair i might give it another try if i can t find the old formula for this shampoo 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|ive been using this for 2 years since garnier fructis changed their triple nutrition line changed and i love this shampoo and conditioner the conditioner is amazing however the shampoo can be a bit stripping but i find that the conditioner fixes the problem i use the conditioner to co wash in the winter and i love it i wear weaves and braids and it works amazing with them as well i do want to try a new shampoo because its expensive but i always seem to go back to them i thought i had 4c hair because in the beginning of my transition my hair was unmanageable but after i started using silicon mix and castor oil my hair is more of a 4a 4b i bleached my hair and this condition seems to be the only thing that works to keep it healthy i loveeee itttt i have to say i have noticed a slight change from when i started using it to now but i still love it ive tried other organix coconut regular argon oil shea butter and my hair felt like straw afterwards so idk what it is about this one but i love it
2014-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|personally i would only use this product again if i had ran out of a better shampoo it does a good job of cleaning my hair and lathers well but doesn t make my hair feel soft at all in fact i can feel my hair drying out as my hair gets cleaner the texture of the shampoo is very silky and thick which feels lovely as i put it on my hair it has a nice smell but doesn t last long after it has been rinsed out i have 4c coarse hair tbh the conditioner is a bit better than the shampoo for the price i think organix could have done a lot better 
2014-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|there doesn t seem to be much oil in this at all unlike the elvive one this is awful it makes my hair frizzy and the only thing good about it is that it smells good
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|makes my hair so so so soft absolutely love it
2014-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|this is probably the worst shampoo and conditioner i have ever used i have really long hip length hair that tends to be naturally wavy or slightly curly so of course i need as much hydration as possible to maintain it and up until using this shampoo and conditioner i have done really well my hair is always shiny and soft and if i have curls they are bouncy and soft however i bought organix renewing argan oil of morocco and after using it once i thought it would be a good buy at first use it makes the hair feel very thick and it lathers up into a dream the conditioner was thick and also made my hair feel really moisturized and thick in the shower but as soon as i rinsed i noticed a big change in my hair it felt rough and brittle i got out of the shower and let it dry and immediately noticed it was frizzy with almost no shine and it was a big tangled mess the next day i did the exact same thing except i blow dried it was a little more manageable but still frizzy and dry and brittle with almost no shine i bought the larger bottle of the conditioner and shampoo and i will not be finishing using either of them because even though this shampoo and conditioner was a little more pricey than what i normally buy it is not worth ruining my hair i have since purchased my usual tresemme and noticed after only one use that my hair was feeling better than after a whole week of using the moroccan oil shampoo from organix don t let the whole quot moroccan oil quot and quot organic quot thing fool you this product is a big waste of money and will torture your hair 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i love this product it has my hair silky and frizz free i dont need any additional products to tame my hair as this works well on its own 
2014-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|thank goodness i bought only a couple of the trave sized bottles it felt very drying on my hair and made my hair tangled it doesn t lather that well either so i m surprised it would be so stripping it does have a nice scent and left my hair shiny but that is pretty much it i am very disappointed as i have had luck with other organix shampoos in the past my favorite is the macadamia one in the brown bottle i will probable reserve the remaining bottles for when i need to clarify or pass them on to family members back to the drawing board 
2014-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|a little info about my hair before i review this product it s long reaches about mid lower back fine straight un dyed and normal with a slight lean towards oily during the warmer months and around my period my usual hair care routine shampoo amp condition focusing mostly on the lower 1 3 of my hair especially the tips every 2 3 days with a bit of argan oil run through after again focusing mostly on the ends with my hands and fingers almost always towel air dried i bought this product because i was desperate this past winter was for my area incredibly cold and cry my normal hair care routine just wasn t cutting it my hair was so dry it was brittle and straw like not something i ever really encounter since i don t straighten or blow dry my hair often i d bought travel sizes of a different shampoo conditioner with argan oil the previous year so i wouldn t have to pack a full sized bottle of oil and remembered liking it couldn t find that brand and saw this at cvs and thought quot what the hell why not quot it worked like a miracle after a few uses my hair was back to it s usual silky soft self i feel like this product gently cleans my hair well without stripping it duh which i really really like this shampoo and the matching conditioner became the only stuff i used during the winter and will definitely use again if the next cold season is the same that said i probably would not use this during the summer or if i had oily hair and would not recommend unless your hair is incredibly dry damaged or you live in a very cold arid climate some other info the packaging is unique imo and stands out in both color and shape amongst the rest of the crap in my shower however it can be difficult to squeeze the product out once you nearing the bottom of the bottle i enjoy the smell of this shampoo it s kind of a light musky floral y scent the texture consistency of both the shampoo and conditioner took some getting used to very viscous and almost gel like it also takes quite a bit of work to get a nice lather going which doesn t bother me in the slightest but may bother others i believe the conditioner says to let it sit on your hair for a few minutes i forget how long exactly but i just leave it for however long it takes to wash exfoliate my face not more than a minute or two i ve noticed while my hair is wet after using this product it s a bit difficult to brush comb through i usually end up letting it air dry most of the way before brushing it once my hair is dry it s so unbelievably soft and it doesn t look too flat either which is a bonus 
2014-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i used it a while ago and never again a friend with dryish hair recommended it to me saying it worked great and it was very moisturizing oh boy she was sooo wrong it left my hair feeling like straw and it wasn t that dry to begin with and also very tangled very bad shampoo 
2014-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|i had high hopes for this product since it has argan oil in it but it left my hair soooo dry i will not buy this again 
2014-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo|its not horrible but for the price i think a one dollar shampoo works exactly the same the only good thing is the smell but other than that it sucks i have to use like a quart of the bottle to make my hair feel clean and to make it lather decently so if you have long 3b a curls steer clear of this product 
2021-02|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i absolutely hate hate haaaattteeee this product i will never use this again my hair is never snarly but i used this shampoo amp conditioner and i could barely even brush through my hair my hair is now dry and fuzzier then ever i was so excited to use this but truly disappointed with the results the only reason i gave 1 star is it smells good that s all this has going for it would absolutely not recommend 
2018-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|after a few weeks with this my hair feels amazing i don t use it every day but a few times a week my crispy ends feel great and look good too it s been rather humid here and my hair isn t frizzing even if i skip the flat iron i ll never be without this i ve been coloring my hair since i was 13 and found sun in i m now 50 dropped out of beauty school along the way but won t let anyone do my color i ve had stubborn grays since my 20s and now have some serious dalt and pepper hair i ve been every color from blonde to black and have out my natural medium dark hair through the wringer more than once currently it s mid back length and jet black some waves and curls long layers i love it i use a hair dryer and flat iron most days and wash almost daily because if i don t my scalp breaks out whew now that we ve met let me tell you why i picked this up on a bogo50 at walgreens i research what goes into my hair i m also on a budget and i hate shopping so i d rather just the drug store or target than ulta for my beauty needs i use very few high end products because they re out of my pay grade the challenges with black hair is that it hates the sun which is a problem because i don t especially in the summer i use a hair dryer almost daily and a few swipes of a flat iron not for stick straight hair but to calm waves and frizz i don t pass over a section more than twice i use leave in conditioners and serums and i also use a clarify shampoo a few times a month to allow my products to work better having said that i know that keratin can be detrimental sometimes and really avoid using any at all costs minimal at best too much and your hair breaks and becomes dry and brittle but i recently noticed my ends being very dry and crispy i upped my cowashing wore my hair up more and shampooed less it didn t help i knew it was time for serious help i figured i had nothing to lose with a keratin treatment at this point i picked up a packet of some other product at walmart for 1 50 and really liked the results i got this set the next day at walgreens and gave used it twice now again i m not looking for pin straight just healtheir ends and calming frizz and flyaways the scent is nice and beachy the conditoner is a nice thick formula and a little goes a long way same with the shampoo after two uses adding a few spritzes of a leave in and the organix coconut milk serum at my ends i already that this one i dried on warm heat without a nozzle till about 90 then on hot with the attachment and a brush again wasn t looking for miracle results but was pleasantly surprised that my crunchy ends feel better i still have a lot of body and volume and still need the flat iron but my hair looks and feels shiny no tangle issues here definitely would buy again 
2018-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i have very dry hair and this combo works great for me even though it is supposed to be a straightening agent of some sort the shampoo is luxurious and does not strip my hair the conditioner is thick and condensed i have naturally beachy waves and this combo does not suppress or remove the waves or body i have less frizz on the days i use this combo i love the nutty chocolately smell above all neither product dries out my hair i co wash every other day with gvp s conditioning balm and the 10 minute miracle hair mask from sally s beauty supply the days i want shampoo i use this organix combo if you have dry hair don t be afraid to try this combo it may work for you like it did for me 
2017-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i really like the scent of this shampoo and conditioner it smells like cocoa butter this shampoo cleanses well and does help a with my frizzy hair it does not strip my hair and does not irritate my scalp what i love most other than the scent is that my hair did seem to look healthier with continued use and i noticed a lot less fall out in the shower as well as my dry itchy scalp was not as angry both the shampoo and conditioner together left my hair clean and soft will i purchase again i am not too sure if i do it will only be the large bottles and only if i can find them on sale it did help with the frizz more so than other smoothing shampoos and conditioners have but it was not so significant to win me over completely i wish i would have been able to find their matching flat iron spray to use along with them to see if that helped more but i could not find it i am also not the biggest fan of the bottles i do like the cute shape to look at but i find them hair to squeeze out the thick formula 
2017-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|one of the only shampoos that works for my hair makes my hair softer and shinier for 2 3 days until i wash it again i took this on holiday with me and my friend borrowed it she loved it too other shampoos from supermarket make my hair feel stripped of moisture and straw like a hairdresser told me to avoid shampoo with sodium laureth sulfate as it strips your hair of moisture so possibly this organix shampoo doesn t contain that although i m not sure it is quite expensive though compared to other supermarket shampoos especially if you re buying the shampoo and conditioner together 
2016-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i normally don t right too many reviews but i felt this one really needed some honest feedback when i first started using this shampoo i was hooked and it really seemed to work well for me i have very dry thin and brittle hair so i was looking for a sulfate free product that would help tame my hair sulfate free yes taming not so much it leaves my already quite dry and somewhat damaged looking hair just the same in other words not much change will probably not buy again when i run out of my supply 
2015-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|love this the shampoo is ridiculously thick you only need the tiniest bit and mix it with water my scalp is oily and prone to itchy painful bumps which have totally gone since i have been using this shampoo and conditioner alternating with the anti breakage keratin oil products from ogx as well my hair is damaged baby fine and very porous normally i need at least twice as much conditioner as i do shampoo not the case with this stuff if you can imagine it s more like a body butter than a body lotion you re getting the idea of how thick and creamy it is i really didn t think this was going to be great with my hair meanwhile i use about half a teaspoon of the conditioner and it is more than enough to massage through from my ears down to the tips i never do my roots because it s so thick it stays on your hands which gives more control of application i m not crazy about the smell it s sweet and nutty almost chocolatey i m sure lots of people would love that though the end result is hair that is surprisingly full soft and silky i m hooked 
2015-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|worst shampoo i have ever used my hair is ver thick and strong i can use any shampoo i was look for a sleek finish however this stripped my hair of nutrients and colour my hairdresser couldn t believe the poor condition of my hair do not buy this it damages and drys out your hair 
2015-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i was so excited to try this shampoo and the conditioner as i ve heard so much about this brand and my mom adores it and she normally uses pureology but this was worse than useless for me the hair right above my neck felt like it had a film over it not greasy but like the conditioner never washed out and the rest of my hair was not smooth or soft it was almost frizzy dry unruly i refused to believe it was this stuff but after reading the lowest reviews on ulta and seeing that others were having the same complaints i decided to dump this shampoo and conditioner 
2015-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i am a big fan of the organix ever straight brazilian keratin therapy conditioner so when i began hunting for the perfect shampoo this caught my interest it is sulfate free after all and has several beneficial ingredients for damaged hair however this shampoo feels harsh on my hair it s very stripping i went 4 days without washing my naturally oily scalp and it left my hair very very dry at the roots i even followed up with a deep conditioning mask tonight thinking the outcome would be different nope my hair is very frizzy and dry at the moment the search for a moisturizing shampoo goes on 
2015-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i loooove this shampoo so much in fact it s my favorite quot keratin protein shampoo quot i use it in the 3 step shampoo conditioner spray oil and it does wonders for my frizzy dyed relatively dry hair i do not use this combo every time i wash my hair but only once a week and the rest of the time use the argan oil shampoo conditioner by the same line ag silver shampoo amp the 3 minute miracle by aussie to keep my hair nice my routine is as follower keratin shampoo conditioner amp 3 minute miracle if i don t feel i have moisture on wet hair i put in my kerastase leave in for blowdrying wait 2 mins amp put in the keratin oil from the same line blow dry halfway amp put in my alterna caviar cc cream blow dry fully amp then put in some more alterna the sea spray shine from organix this routine makes my hair so soft and beautiful but again i firmly believe you shouldn t be using this shampoo conditioner combo everytime you wash my only complaint would be the price 12 cad but it does come one sale often 
2015-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|this shampoo seems to have a lot of protein in it so for me it almost seems to function like a mini protein treatment it cleans my hair quite well for being sulfate free but the protein in it does leave it feeling a bit rough so i like to follow up w something that doesn t have protein and that is a bit more moisturizing it does however seem to strengthen my hair and bring out my waves so if i want to wear my hair down and wavy it is a great choice to prep it for that i wouldn t use this on a daily basis but it serves its purpose oh and i love the smell 
2015-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i have no idea why this product is rated the lowest of all the organix shampoo and conditioner line for years i ve been using purology nana works and have enjoyed it despite the price when i was going on vacation i didn t feel like taking it with me so i just grabbed some random shampoo and conditioner on way to the airport they were 5 dollars at vacation i realized i liked how this product made my hair feel i d even step over the line and say the texture is a dupe for purology it s concentrated the exact same organix 5 dollars v s purology 150 dollars each might i add 10 bucks compared to 300 i like the way organix feels on my hair better wtf was i thinking 
2015-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i just switched to this shampoo last night from pureology s hydrate and i have to say i am impressed and in love i had noticed my hair slowly beginning to get very dry and break off fall out with the pureology shampoo and so i switched to this by a friends recommendation i was really impressed when reading the ingredients list however mildly concerned about the dimethicone potentially weighing down my hair however that doesn t seem to be a problem yet i have very fine long low back hair and a lot of it it usually fries with a slight wave after using this shampoo and conditioner my hair felt clean and soft and began to dry almost instantly less porous healthy retains water less today it has been very soft voluminous smooth and hasn t fallen down or gotten greasy i ll be interested to see how the silicon potentially builds up over time but a good clarifying shampoo should take care of that 
2015-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i really like this shampoo firstly it s sulfate free hence it doesn t steal my hair s natural oils secondly it s infused with coconut oil an shea butter it really nourishes my hair and makes my hair feel silky and soft i would recommend this to people with dry frizzy hair 
2014-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|amaaaaazing my hair looked alive after 
2014-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i really adore this shampoo my mom gave it to me after she didn t like the way it felt after she used it on her thin hair she said her hair felt a little weighed down and oily with this product i love this though it makes my thick already stick straight hair just the right softness seriously the moisture with this shampoo is fab but i can see how someone with thinner hair would be dissatisfied or if you had really oily hair it would be less nice so perfect for someone who has thicker hair that s relatively dry like most curly haired women i suppose but definitely not for thinner hair i can t vouch for straightness properties my hair is naturally stick straight 
2014-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|this was a decent product in all honesty it really didn t do much for my dry coarse thick frizzy short hair i felt as if it just added another thick layer rather than doing anything the same goes with the matching conditioner it didn t even help with frizz but rather just another built up layer this product doest not make your hair straight it only makes it slightly smooth and that s about it it smells decent but it s really just one of these eh shampoos and conditioners
2014-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i have found the organix line to be a bit hit or miss but i really like this one the smell is great and it really does straighten my hair which generally has a mild wave to it it s a little drying so make sure to use a good moisturising conditioner with it i d buy this again 
2014-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|this is one of my favorite shampoos sold on the shelf my hair is very tightly curled while also frizzy and difficult to style i really desired that sleek pin straight hair look so i bought this shampoo with the conditioner both being 7 99 it has an interesting smell to it nothing really fruity or anything like most shampoos but none the less it has a nice aroma and it very easy to work through hair you can even see less frizz as you wash it out then i used the conditioner leaving it in for three minutes then ran my hair under cold water for a few seconds when my hair fully dried there were still parts that were frizzy and my curls were still there yet there was some shine and straightening it was less of a challenge it honestly was pretty sleek when i straightened it also provided a nice amount of shine and clean feeling worth it in my opinion 
2014-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|worst shampoo i ve ever used i have pretty healthy wavy hair this shampoo made my hair very dry and i started to loose hair a bunch so i stopped immidiately and switch to another brand shampoo what a difference 
2014-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|very disappointed i bought this after reading good reviews but i am very disappointed with the result i don t have super coarse hair but my hair is generally wavy frizzy and puffy appearance the bottle is of reasonable size not too big texture brown and thick i have to use quite a lot for my above waist long hair smell ok after use my hair is still wavy frizzy and puffy and in fact it is more frizzy and puffy than usual it does straightened slightly price 15 20 for a bottle overall it is not cheap and it does not work and actually made my hair more frizzy and puffy i wish i could return it and certain will not recommend buying it 
2014-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|this shampoo works as advertised i have long thick wavy hair after washing and always need to straighten but after just one use of this i didnt need to straighten just my bangs however it dried my hair i would reccomend this to someone with already healthy thin hair 
2014-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i really enjoy using this shampoo and the matching formula conditioner one thing to keep in mind unless you have barely any waves curls in your hair it won t straighten it it just won t i certainly didn t expect it too i have very wavy hair with a few spiral curls thrown in so as long as you have realistic expectations for this product i think you will enjoy it i love the texture of my hair after using this product it feels very smooth and silky especially when you consider that i have coarse color treated hair my hair also looks very healthy after using this product i know some people have complained about the smell but to me it is very pleasant i suppose it s just one of those personal preference things i will definitely buy this again once i run out 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i bought this shampoo a few weeks ago because i have naturally curly hair this shampoo smells great it smells like coconuts cocoa butter after i dried my hair it was a lot straighter and i had less frizz i liked this product because it smoothed my fly aways the only problem i had with this product was that it can make your hair feel too soft when i first started using it it would make my hair feel a little greasy but it doesn t do that anymore i d buy this product again because i didn t have to straighten my hair too much 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i love this shampoo and conditioner i feel it really helped my hair i use to dye and bleach my hair a lot but thought i should go back to my natural hair i almost have all my natural hair back except for my tips that seemed to be damaged and dry so i gave this shampoo a try and i love it it makes me hair super soft and my tips no longer look so dry i am almost gone through my first bottle but i think i ll try another organix product first before i repurchase this one

2013-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|didn t like it i love organix shampoos but hated this one i m a cosmetician and do lots of research on hair products i m not saying this is a bad product because it s not but this specific one dried out my hair the reason being is because people my age don t usually need keratin treatments so what i did was basically stressing out my hair by adding more of something that it already had this would probably work wonders for people who lack keratin just wasn t for me 
2013-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|this stuff is amazing i had super curly thick hair and whenever i straighten it it wouldn t look that good after using this shampoo and conditioner it looks amazing everyone always comments on it and ask how i got it so straight and how good it smells love love love it 
2013-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i was not impressed with product it did no justice for my hair and i was not a huge fan of the scent 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|this product made my hair stronger and shinier great stuff but you need to alternate with a moisture shampoo and conditioner this is keratin protein and you should only use this about once a week as too much protein makes hair snap after it s had too much so if you get the moisture and protein balance right and use this about once a week it s shamazing 
2013-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|this shampoo dried out my hair and left it in huge knots every time in used it i also felt that it didn t clean my hair or scalp at all and as far as their claim for straightening it say its a big lie like i said all it did was knot my hair up terribly 
2013-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy| sigh i love the organix hair product lines every one except this one as usual i looked over reviews before i purchased it because of the price to product ratio and decided to go for it unfortunately this was a bad move as my hair is now dry frizzy limp and notty it is quite painful actually and i have lost a lot of hair because of this one the moment i use other organix products my hair goes back to normal with no side effects i am not entirely sure why this certain shampoo did not meet my hairs standards because of the cost i am too stubborn to throw it out so will stick with it until it is used up maybe mixing a few poos will help 
2013-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i have quadruple processed hair and this product was amazing smells really good very moisturizing i used the conditioner alone i left it in for 30 minutes i prefer deep conditioning my hair is smooth soft and manageable after using it i purchased the entire system i have been in the beauty industry for over 10 years and the ingredients in this conditioner are excellent basically everything you need to bring overprocessed hair back to life this is very similar to aveda s smooth infusion and damage remedy combined loved it

2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i definitely found that this shampoo helped make my hair straighter and there were no frizzies i have naturally straight hair on the finer side which will dry to a slight wave if i let it air dry i also get insane frizzies with flyaways and find that many shampoos which claim to be smoothing and anti frizz actually make my frizziness worse this one however works wonders my hair was super smooth super soft and super straight i usually have to blow dry and flat iron to get the straight look that i m after yet after using this shampoo my hair only needed the blow dry to be straight it was also so easy to comb through my hair when it was wet and the blow dry was so quick my hair just seemed to naturally fall into perfect place the scent is also really amazing kind of like a chocolate caramel nutty concoction i find that using this shampoo with the organix coconut milk conditioner worked the best for my hair the keratin conditioner was a bit too lightweight for me if you ve got naturally straight hair which you want to give a little more oomph to give this shampoo a try update for unknown reasons this shampoo stopped working for me after using it for about 2 weeks it just started making my hair limp and unmanageable i had a similar experience with the organix coconut milk shampoo i m not sure what it is about organix products but they just don t seem to stand up to the test of time i m done with the brand and would recommend to anyone who is interested in it to look elsewhere for an organic hair care line 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i ve used the shampoo and a conditioner both and i like them a lot they make my hair soft and manageable and really easy to comb through and style it doesn t help straighten my hair but my hair is naturally wavy curly and it did help with frizziness and dryness if you have naturally straight hair that dries with a tiny bit of wave to it this might help i won t be rebuying because it doesn t beat my old shampoo and conditioner which i ran out of and for this stuff to have until i went to ulta again
2013-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|this practically full bottle is sitting on my bathroom counter and may still be sitting there till the end of time of course it doesn t help straighten your hair and beyond that bold faced lie it made my hair feel utterly limp it could be beneficial the next time i shampoo my longhaired ultra fluffy cat 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|lets cut to the chase i like this product because it makes my hair soft and manageable but it doesnt make my hair straight but another thing i like is that it makes my hair lighter since the shampoo and conditioner are brown it makes my brown hair lighter i also have an oily and flaky scalp thanks to the suave professionals but when i switched to this shampoo my scalp was clean after 2 washes 
2013-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i bought the shampoo and conditioner from this line and they are fine products my hair looks and feels clean after use the problem is that the product also claims to help straighten hair and i did not experience this effect to even the slightest degree it was also quite pricey for a drugstore product especially since it is packaged with less product than most ds bottles of shampoo and conditioner my expectations were not met the claims were not met and i will not be repurchasing 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy| despite the negative reviews on this shampoo i actually think it is quite good the smell is wonderful and it leaves my hair squeaky clean my hair feel flexible and renewed after using this but i have noticed that the ends of my hair have become a little brittle but i am not sure if it is because of shampoo or because lately my diet has not been balanced anyway i ve been using organix shampoos for 2 years now and i am not disappointed in this one either although i will not repurchase it 
2013-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i m not usually a comment person but i read some of the reviews after trying this product this is a keratin therapy shampoo a key tell tale sign that your hair needs keratin is if it feel slimy in the shower it means your hair has too much moisture and needs the keratin to balance it out this explains the dryness that some of you experienced being that it was too much for some of you your hair didnt need it i am a cosmetologist and really emphasize to my clients that they need to pay attention to the quot feels quot of their hair to figure out what it really needs not what you want 
2012-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i m quite surprised to see so many negative reviews on this product but i suppose i am just an outlier i love this product it works wonders on my hair and yes it does actually straighten my mermaid y wavy hair and does reduce almost all of the frizz trust me there s a sizable amount this being said i have a theory as to why so many reviews have trouble i only wash my hair 2 3 times a week i think using this shampoo and conditioner any more than that would be too harsh on your hair and cause many of the problems other reviews are having on top of this i also try to wash my hair in luke warm water another preventative measure to reduce drying my suggestion would be to try out one or both of these options when using this shampoo and conditioner as i have had nothing but success from both products 
2012-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|lathers well with pleasant scent after using shampoo with everstraight conditioner blowdrying and flat iron my hair feels the softest and healthiest it has in many years i have coarse frizzy prone hair that is colored honey kissed blonde i plan to continue using these products 
2012-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i initially bought this product because i was looking for a decent sulfate free shampoo this wasn t the one for me while i love the smell has a very chocolatey cocoa butter type smell it is incredibly drying it made my hair very tangled and knotted it works alright when used with the conditioner but i still felt like my hair was dried out 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|after reading all these reviews i finally realize why i ve been losing clumps of hair in the shower when i ve never had that problem before granted i m a hairdresser and have access to tons of professional products but i wanted to try it out the only good thing about this stuff is the scent but it certainly isn t good enough to look past everything else doesn t leave my hair feeling clean moisturized soft or anything else claimed on the bottle lots of tangles and tons of hair in my brush not to mention the ingredients on the label scare me organix i don t think so its loaded with cones amp all kinds of sulfates gross will not purchase again 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i brought the tiny versions of the shampoo and conditioner about a week ago i didn t notice it was for curly hair though my mistake i had heard some good things about the organix line and decided to try it out the first time i used it it was wonderful my hair was very soft shiny and dandruff free the next time i used the product it was a little different my hair became was filled with tangles and very hard to manage i thought it was because i didn t use enough conditioner because my hair was also very very dry the last time i used it a couple days ago it became it s worst ever i could hardly brush my hair without using detangler i couldn t even put it in a pony tail without losing tons of hair from trying to brush it though it made my hair shiny and a bit soft it has to be the worst shampoo conditioner i ve ever brought i will not be using this again 
2012-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|soft ha i think not this made my hair super dry i have short normal slightly wavy hair it looked dirty and it started falling out do not buy 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy| continued from prior post during her few minutes away she looked up the product online to check the ingredients because she was astounded that a shampoo could do that much damage the lady in the shampoo bowl right next to me witnessed everything happening to me and said quot what is that product tell me so i can avoid it quot when she came back she told me that in her professional opinion sometimes keratin can be too drying even though on your shampoo bottle it only says quot this rich formual of brazilian coconut oil and keratin proteins to smooth and strengthen your curly or wavy tresses quot the stylist felt that my hair had an extreme reaction to this dryness and that is why i got massive clumps of impenetrable tangles at that point that was little comfort somewhat of an explanation sure but little comfort at this point i have been laying back in a shampoo bowl with two stylists working with litte success on getting these out and quot these quot are all over the back of my head thinking of what to do next they put more intense conditioner on my head put me in a plastic cap and put me under head hoping that would soften these dreadlock style clumps during that time they consulted with the lead stylist as to what to do next after awhile the lead stylist knelt down beside my dryer and the concerned look on her face made me start to cry immediately i told her quot don t tell me you can t do anything but cut them out right i knew it quot she assured me not to worry that she would do all she could to help me so she wouldn t have to cut them out that she has experience working with some clients with dreadlocks and has experience with difficult processes like this i felt better somewhat for the time being the lead stylist allison took me back to her station and with the assistance of the two other stylists they began again the tedious and painstaking tast of trying to undo these wickedly tight clumps of hair after another 2 hours of this i hesitatingly asked quot so you still think you don t have to cut it out if you did how much would you have to take off quot allison paused and put her hand where the clump ended and said quot eight inches but i don t want to have to do that let s keep trying quot all i heard was 8 inches i sat there praying for god to give her and the other 2 stylists the continued patience and skill to work through my hair so it wouldn t have to be cut i came into this salon at 2 15 pm i left a little after 6 00 pm this is how long it took 3 stylists to get through this hairmagedden and i don t say that to be funny i mean it and the physical pain of them trying to get through was excruciating despite their best efforts to minimize my discomfort i said i will go through anything just as long as they can try and save my long hair when all 3 stylists got through i was back by the shampoo bowl getting a light shampoo and another deep condition after that they didn t want to dry or style my hair because of all that me and my hair went through in those 4 hours they left it damp and gently braided it and told me to let it dry that way and let my hair and scalp rest they also suggested that i take some ibuprofen when i get home to help me with all the pain i went through today is the 30th the day after my hair is still in the braid and i m afraid to take it out because i expect to see considerable damage from all the picking they did with those rat tail combs mind you i am forever grateful for all their hard work and patience they saved my long hair i can t say enough about these women and the wonderful job they did and also their compassion despite how my long hair looks now and the damage done i still have it they could have taken the lazy way out and advised that i cut it but they didn t they saw my tears and panic and went to work to try and save my hair like those stylists it s astounding to me that your shampoo could do so much damage a shampoo what on earth why if i was prone to fooling around with chemicals and colors at home well then i guess i deserve to have my hair wrecked and shouldn t cry about it but i don t i simply washed my hair this appointment yesterday cost me 70 00 this is the most quot expensive shampoo quot i ve ever had i don t know what you can do as a company to warn people on your bottles but you need to do something this has been the most harrowing experience i have ever had costly in physical pain and money not too mention the fear i had the whole time it s simply wrong that a product could do that these stylists talked to me about keratin and the new fad about brazilian treatments it works for some but it can be very drying grant you i did not use a chemical at home but only a shampoo but the shampoo touts quot brazilian therapy with keratin quot if there are risks with keratin it should say so on your bottle i told they stylists that i thought keratin was a good thing that it is a protein and a building block for hair they said yes that s true but keratin can be very drying on some people and in my case it was so drying it made my hair form very bad clumps to say that i m disappointed is an understatement i don t even want to look at my hair at this point i can also assure you that i saw loads and loads of hair fall to the floor as they were attempting to undo these massive clumps but not because of them being careless they were not but trying to be gentle as possible really what 3 stylists do you know that wants to stand for 4 hours trying to undo a mess like that not many but they did i told them that i would let your company know what happened if you have any questions or doubts i m sure you can talk to the lead stylist allison the ha
2012-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i loved it it left my hair feeling so soft and clean it was so easy to comb through and to blow out this is my new favorite shampoo i have nappy thick hair i loved it 
2012-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i bought this shampoo on a whim just because i liked the scent it smells wonderful i wish i could find a perfume that smells this good i was also surprised by how moisturizing it is i usually wash my hair at night and then sleep on it braided i have not had a bad hair day since using this product and i ve gotten so many compliments when i bought the shampoo i didn t realize it was meant to help straighten hair mine is naturally wavy and it s still just as wavy while using this that s fine by me but someone who us looking for a straightening shampoo would be disappointed i m giving it five stars because i can go into a drugstore and get a product that gives me the results of something i d get at a salon you can t beat that 
2012-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|used with matching conditioner like the fact that my hair feels properly cleansed after shampooing don t like how some shampoos leave something behind conditioner adds the softness back in and my hair does have a bit extra shine like the tropical scent i wouldn t buy again because i still have frizz i don t mind my hair not being quot ever straight quot but i was hoping it would eliminate frizz 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|shampoo made my hair stringy and felt like it stripped the oils out of your hair when wet conditioner is hard to get out of the bottle conditioner is thick but doesn t really do much for moisturizing your hair when all is said and done will not buy again 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|if i could give this no stars i absolutely would not only because the treatment did not work but because customer service at organix was honestly the worst i have ever experienced and that is truly saying something i followed the directions word for word carefully and using the products they ask to use a hot straightening iron after having to spend close to 3 hours on my hair followed by an awful 48 hours of greasy smelly hair i honestly saw no results i was hoping for anything anything for me to feel like paying 15 was worth it but honestly i should have just thrown my money in the trash can i then followed up with an email to organix to see what they could offer advice insight or a refund but was offered instead the worst customer service ever after sending an initial inquiry email it took two weeks for any response in which they scolded me for not following directions seriously if i didn t follow directions why would i be complaining about an ineffective product when i responded to that email it then took 3 weeks for another response with this quot i apologize but we do not offer a money back guarantee quot no greeting no name no nothing i am hoping to be in touch with a supervisor or manager but after the service i have seen i m not expecting it if i could report this company to somewhere i absolutely would any ideas so i guess the bottom line is if you are prepared to waste 15 sore arms and loads of time on this terrible product then be my guest go for it for all those who are still thinking about it i just suggest waiting for an online deal where you can go to a professional hair stylist i just found a deal for 79 and actually see results sincerely 15 out of pocket
2012-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|my hair is wavy by nature and i do get some frizz i tried this shampoo because it was recommended to me i love the smell it s not floral like other shampoos and almost has a cocoa scent to it my hair is definitely less frizzy but it doesn t work as well as so many reviewers have said it does 
2012-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|this stuff smellls sooooooo good it makes my hair very soft and moisturized it doesn t really help it to be more straight i wasn t really expecting that much of it a shampoo anyways 
2012-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|very expensive and very drying on my hair i thought it would work miracles but it did completely the opposite never buying this again the only good thing was that it smelled lovely i m getting the cocoa keratin daily shampoo instead it s got better reviews and it uses argan oil i can t believe i chose organix over cocoa gt 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i really thought this was going to be a great product because it smells sooo soo good and it was expensive i needed a really good shampoo because my hair needed it this was a mistake it made my hair look more frizzy than before i can t even brush it without ripping out hair i will never buy this product again the only good thing about it is that it smells wonderful but i am sure i can find a shampoo conditioner set that smells the same or close to it 
2012-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|i found this shampoo to be extremely drying in my hair that s not what i expect shampoo to do it s supposed to be nourishing and hydrating and in this shampoo s case it s supposed to contribute to straightening the tresses all of these claims were false and actually quite disappointing the only positive aspect of this shampoo is the lovely coconut scent and the fact that it s cruelty free unfortunately that s not enough to get me to repurchase i d also like to point out that the organix shampoos amp conditioners contain many ingredients that are not quot natural quot or quot organic quot at all 
2012-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy|love this shampoo and the conditioner for the following reasons 1 smells lovely coconut 2 leaves my long hair feeling clean 3 leaves my hair feeling smooth and manageable 4 doesn t make my hair fly a way 5 great shampoo at a good price my only gripe with is with the conditioner bottle as you start to use it up squeezing the conditioner out can be quite difficult because it is quite thick either than or i m lacking in upper body strength keep the bottle tipped upside and its easy though i was fed up with pantene making my hair fly away and stripping my colour out this is brilliant love it x
2021-02|4.0|Coconut Miracle Oil Penetrating Oil|lightweight hair oil that smells soooo lovely like coconut oil and vanilla oil lasts awhile since you only need a few drops and the scent does linger 
2021-02|2.0|Coconut Curls Finishing Spray|after i had layers added to my bob i started styling my hair to take advantage of some natural curl that i suddenly discovered my stylist said a heavy hairspray would weigh down the waves so i bought this finishing spray on the plus side it keeps my hair soft not crunchy the minus my hair is fine and needs a stronger hold if i want the curl to be exactly as it was immediately after styling i will use up the product especially on days when i go overboard i m still experimenting and don t mind if the curls relax also my husband compliments me on how good my hair smells when i use this i think it reminds him of coconut cake 
2021-01|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|another shampoo review from me as i ve mentioned in another review i have been testing shampoos to find one that works for me and this shampoo certainly did not great packaging great smell not so great results i have thick curly hair but very fine strands what i found is that this shampoo tends to weigh my hair down yes it makes it more manageable but i m not ready to compromise bounce and body for manageable hair maybe it would have been a holy grail if i had a more rough hair texture for now with regards to this product i m going to have to unfortunately pass
2021-01|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|kudos to this shampoo for stopping a massive hair fall i really bought this shampoo to thicken my hair but there have been so many side benefits that this one is going into my haircare rotation the scent is a little unusual but i don t mind that as it doesn t stick around after the shower is over and gives me something pleasant to smell while the shampoo is doing its thing 
2021-01|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i have fine thin really not a lot of hair color treated hair and i love this shampoo as others have noted the consistency of the shampoo is odd very thick and blobby it is not hard to spread or lather though i don t like the smell which is like perfume to me but it does not stick around and isn t strong so i can ignore it easily this really helps my hair appear thicker and with this shampoo i am able to use conditioner every time i wash and my weak dry hair needs hydration but of course is usually weighed down i have in the past tried to integrate protein treatments in my routine and they may have helped the structure of my hair but this helps it look soft and fuller i have not tried the conditioner in this line so i am using ones i have it is not actually thickening my hair not sure any beauty based hair product would but it is about as thick as it has ever looked i can easily find this at drugstores and it is reasonably priced 
2020-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i don t care for the consistency of og shampoos they re too much like jello you need too much product to yield any type of lather the breaking point was when my husband told me i smelled like wet dog what every woman wants to hear after a shower 
2020-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|it makes my hair feel really soft and has a wonderful smell 
2020-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|in frame is ogx thick and full biotin and collagen shampoo and conditioner contents vitamin b7 biotin collagen and hydrolysed wheat protein vitamin b7 biotin infuses nutrients to every strand of hair collagen has a plumping action and adds more volume to your hair hydrolyzed wheat protein is an amber colored liquid derived from wheat germ it thickens and adds volume to thinning hair and adds shine to your hair it s a sulfate free shampoo and can be used on all hair types net vol 385 ml price both the products cost rs 725 each personlly it worked for me because i was having a lot of hairfall and this combination reduced my hairfall and also restored my hair s volume ratings 5 5
2019-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|made my thin and dry hair feel very hydrated and much less frizzy 
2019-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i have fine textured hair but it s not thin even though i get highlights regularly my hair leans toward oily i have to wash daily or it looks greasy moisturizing shampoos tend to make it look too limp i didn t have high hopes when i tried this out but i was pleasantly surprised it doesn t dry me out it leaves my hair soft and shiny but not weighed down this isn t the only shampoo i use i have several i like and i use a clarifying one at least once a week so i don t give anything a chance to build up too much on my hair my best friend asked what i had done to my hair because it looks so much fuller if you have dry hair this probably won t be best for you i ll definitely repurchase 
2019-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i have fine straight and flat hair and this didn t weigh my hair down too much it has a nice scent and makes my hair look healthy and shiny definitely recommend 
2019-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i love this shampoo amp conditioner so much it s saved my limp thin greasy ugly hair my hair feels soft and thicker with just one use and doesn t feel dry at all however i do have super oily hair so it might be drying for other hair types the smell is really strong but i enjoy it my hair is dyed and the colour doesn t wash out from this shampoo either this shampoo and conditioner are a little pricey i think i paid 9 10 cad for each bottle and i feel like i don t get as much product as i would with cheaper products but i ve tried a lot of other cheaper volume thickening shampoos and this one is the only one that has made a difference i don t think my hair has more volume but it definitely feels and looks thicker 
2019-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|horrible my hair falls like its autumn season on my scalp 
2019-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i don t like the heavy smell and it leaves my wavy hair greasy and dried out all at once i also noticed more shedding while i was using this plus the list of ingredients is way too long for a brand called quot organix quot 
2018-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|hairloss patches of hairloss affecting many people in household i used this item thinking like i would any regular shampoo at first my hair felt as if a chemical or hair texturizer was used in my hair i didnt think anything of it after a while i noticed my hair getting thin thinner eventually hair falling out patches of hairloss in the form of circles as if i was shampooing it in circular motions leaving its mark as if it was a chemical burn locations around my ears back of head edges i have areas of my head where hair is very shallow and not growing at the same paste as the rest of head hair is very thin and not growing back in certain areas i went to doctor i dont have hiv or any immunodeficiency virus or illness its been over a year and hair wont grow back in certain areas hair is thinner and shorter in certain areas do not buy
2018-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|good if you have thin hair otherwise too expensive
2018-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|this does have a volume effect on my hair but coats my hair too much and causes build up on my scalp very quickly which then means hairfall i used the whole set but didn t finish any of the products my favorite was the shampoo which did not require a conditioner afterward the conditioner was too weak on my hair on its own or when combined with other shampoos and it didn t help much the smell is an issue with this one it smellt too much like a sweet cigar or tobacco which i didn t like but ymmv i have benefited greatly from biotin but only when i took it orally 
2018-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|this was amazing when my hair was healthy and dyed dark brown it gave my hair lovely volume and kept it soft then when i went blonde through about 5 heavy highlighting sessions i repurchased it thinking it would help my dried out bleached hair nope it just made it super tangled so now my hair needs something more repairing and i won t be repurchasing this but if you have non damaged hair that needs a bit of volume this is probably for you 
2018-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|aside from how overly perfumed this shampoo was and therefore my hair i didn t notice anything else with this nor any difference in my hair quality by switching to this it lathers nicely and feels like a more higher end formula but it leaves my hair completely flat for some reason and weighed down i also notice my hair gets oily a lot quicker than usual when using this which didn t happen before it s a shame as was interested to see how biotin and collagen would work for my hair as both ingredients are something i take as an oral supplement but not applied to hair before not something that i would go out and re purchase in a hurry selena x my hg list as i ve sampled many 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer antipodes rejoice light day cream 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment 
2018-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i purchased both the shampoo and conditioner 19 5 ounces in each bottle for about 9 a piece at the drugstore i ve been using them for about a month my fine shiny color treated hair needs volume but moisturizing properties too most products containing protein take care of the thin and breakage but dry out my ends most moisturizing products weigh my hair down this contains protein but moisturizer too this gave me what i needed wonderfully my hair looks thick shiny and full with a spicy and sweet fragrance but it still smells clean i have noticed that even though it states on the bottle that the effects of the products are temporary i have noticed the volume lasts less breakage to my ends and less hair fall since using it it hasn t turned my blonde ends brassy or stripped the color elsewhere i ve used it in multiple water hardness while traveling and i get good results i have not noticed any building up of residue i ve travelled with the full size bottles something i don t normally do and haven t experienced any leaks or loose caps i ve dropped them in the shower a few times the bottle is very sturdy i m pleasantly surprised i might stick with this system 
2018-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|like someone said smells like an old lady perfume 100 quite expensive and did not work well for my dyed long straight hair scalp and hair felt very oily might be difficult to squeeze out the product from the bottle
2018-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|great shampoo and conditioner with a gorgeous scent i have fine hair and this conditions well without weighing down 
2018-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|the australian market versions of ogx are like washing your hair in in dish detergent the conditioners are just as bad 
2017-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i have short hair with no body and i ve tried many products to give it volume this shampoo works the top flip cap tends to break off so i deducted for packaging after i shampoo my hair feels thick and tangled and i m tempted to use conditioner but that just weights down the hair ulta has bogo sales sometimes which is how i started using it 
2017-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|it lathers well but smells like an old woman perfume i couldn t stand the smell of my hair wet or dry my husband even made a comment about me smelling like an old woman perfume that was the last straw amp i returned it i gave it 2 weeks to try and like it but it did nothing for me regarding volume 
2017-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|this brand used to be my go to for sulfate free shampoos and conditioners in the drugstore once i colored my hair it needed a little more tlc but if you have healthy hair this is a great suflate free option it also lathers like regular shampoo which is nice sulfate free has come a long way 
2017-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|well bummer i was really hoping this shampoo would work for me but alas no i agree with another reviewer that said the only thing it s got going for it is the smell washing your hair with it is a very pleasant sensory experience the formula feels really good on your hair amp hands and it has a warm sugary smell however that s where anything positive ends for me it leaves my hair dry tangly even with a deep conditioner and the ends look stringy thin yuck in addition my regular styling products are rendered totally ineffective i really can t understand how this works for people with the hair type it s intended for fine amp thin my hair is baby fine and i don t have a lot of it so my choice of shampoo matters this one is a definite dud for me and i won t repurchase 
2017-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i ve always liked this brand but even more so after i cut my hair short i did that in part because it s been shedding a lot and getting a bit thinner and troublesome and after the cut this line was worked so well for me i first got the anti fallout with the niacin and caffeine but i like to alternate because my hair seems to get fatigue from using the same products all the time so i added this to the rotation because of the biotin and all that and like it a lot first off it does have a really strong fragrance the shampoo in particular though the conditioner while scented isn t as potent i struggled to figure out the scent because it s not something that screams shampoo to me and it was weirdly familiar finally it came to me it smells a lot though i don t think it s a duplicate of tokyomilk s honey and the moon that one is described as smelling of honey sugared violet jasmine and sandalwood this one is very close to that it s a bit sweet a bit flowery and a bit something else fortunately i like the tokyomilk so this was a happy find even though i generally hate overly fragranced product the shampoo lathers well and leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped the conditioner isn t heavy in that it doesn t leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy i think i get a bit of volume from this duo too nothing major but i m happier with it than i was with other products by other brands that left my hair looking limp and lifeless i also notice less shedding with this line and the niacin caffeine line so i m happy with that too it s too soon to tell if the biotin how much of that is actually in these i can t say will make a difference but as a day to day shampoo and conditioner i m happy with how it cleans adds a bit of body and makes my hair fluff up a bit 
2017-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i have purchased this numerous times my hair is very long and platinum this stuff definitely gives my long hair added volume and the color of it is a slight purple which keeps my blonde looking nice and white 
2016-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i would have given it 5 stars after the first week of use now i am on my 3rd week i saw the not so good results even after the first wash i can already feel and see the claims of this brand my hair feels lighter but with volume the hair fall even minimized i was very happy because i thought i already found a holy grail for my hair problems however after maybe three weeks of washing my hair fall fall problem is back and i am also starting to have dandruff the same thing happened to my husband who is also using both shampoo and conditioner you may still give it a try because it smells really good the sweet smell last all day and it can really give your limp and oily hair a volume 
2016-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i m obsessed with how this shampoo makes my hair look there is a very noticeable difference in my hair thickness volume when i use this vs other shampoos this gives a lift and noticeable bounce to my hair which is long and stick straight it seriously makes it look like i got an expensive blowout every time i use it i never use the conditioner though just shampoo rinse and done all other volumizing shampoos make my hair feel greasy heavy and gross like it s coated with something with this my hair is light clean fresh and has noticeable volume i loveeee this stuff 
2016-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i decided to give this shampoo a second chance after having not used it for a few months due to it making my hair feel limp and greasy after subsequent use while unimpressed before i m even more unimpressed this time i used about a quarter sized glob of shampoo for my shoulder length hair and it lathered okay it s only been a few hours since i washed my hair and already my hair feels greasy heavy and unwashed as if i didn t even wash it at all my hair is a bit more on the thick side so maybe that played a factor in the results i received but i would not recommend this product the only positive things i can say about this shampoo is that the scent is pleasant and the packaging is cute otherwise mediocre shampoo especially for the price 
2016-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|by far the least drying thickening product lathers well and smells clean does not turn blonde hair brassy and adds a lot of volume to fine long hair even air dried if your hair is dry as is either pair this with a good mask or skip altogether because like all thickening shampoos this will also dry your hair out although it won t be stiff brittle or waxy just coarser to touch and less shiny it will be possible to skip an extra day between washes even for very fine hair those who didn t have any luck ingesting biotin due to acne may experience a similar side effect with this shampoo paired with the same conditioner they make a great volume booster for flat hair but weightless shine serum will be necessary for styling the set should have a leave in spray as well but not a single store carried it for some reason 
2016-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i liked the scent made my hair fell like straw in he shower but after using the conditioner it went away left my hair feeling soft once dry the packaging is lage and bulky but every last bit of the shampoo comes it unlike the matching conditioner i would only by again is i found t on sale again 
2016-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|if fragrance is listed in the ingredients before the actual ingredients the brand says makes this shampoo special then you know there aren t enough in it to make a difference i purchased this based on raving reviews by a youtuber i wish i had read the ingredients list first the fragrance is so obnoxious it s like they couldn t decide if they wanted it to smell like cotton candy or cheap perfume so they threw both in and hoped for the best the shampoo itself left my hair feeling slimy i assume due to the copious amount of cones in the formula the conditioner was moderately better but i cannot recommend the shampoo 
2016-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i had high hopes for this shampoo since i have fine thin hair this shampoo make my hair dry and heavy the next day it was matted to my head it felt coated and i got no volume whatsoever the only positive is the smell 
2016-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i love this shampoo it s sulfate free and friendly for my naturally wavy 2b 2c fine bleached hair it does lather some and the smell is divine just like aquolina pink sugar with all sulfate free shampoos you have to thoroughly wet your hair and saturate with water first i find i don t need a ton of this shampoo on my head for it to work i use this towel dry then put on redken frizz dismiss conditioner about 1 tbsp and leave that in comb through then air dry and scrunch i love it 
2016-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|this product is just amazing i don t think i will ever switch shampoo conditioner again my hair gave me a huge fuss over the last few months because of some new medication i was on it was greasy at the roots frizzy at the ends flat and just all around unappealing i tried a lot of expensive things 30 shampoos diy masks nothing worked i almost invested in new wash but luckily this product saved me normally i have tonnes of volume and my hair is hard to tame but it was lifeless when i started this new medication i was getting super upset about it the medication i was put on is a quot rest of your life quot kind but this shampoo conditioner saved my hair after trying this product for the first time i got several compliments at work telling me my hair looked soft shiny and asking if i d redone my colour my hair feels thick and soft again and has its wave and volume back my roots don t get greasy until the 3rd day i m truly in love with this line of products 
2016-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i am currently experiencing severe withdrawal i have too many other shampoos that i have to use up before i can let myself repurchase this one but i love this shampoo as well as the corresponding conditioner my hair is fine but i have a lot of it i like that it reduces frizz and makes my hair feel glossy it s not the best for the hottest months of summer though since it is on the heavy side for a shampoo grease arrives slightly sooner years ago after the first time i used this shampoo i immediately recommended it to my mom and little sister and they ve been using it ever since the scent is divine and i find myself sniffing my hair all day after using this shampoo my husband seems to dig the fragrance as well i ve caught him using it a couple of times which is hilarious since his head is shaved bald 
2016-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i am writing this review for my boyfriend who uses this more often than i do his hair has been thinning for a few years so when i came across this shampoo i picked it up for him to try he had been using it for a few months before getting his hair cut and the woman who cut his hair commented on how much fuller his hair felt and she wanted to know what he had been using she was surprised that a drug store shampoo had made such a difference i should not that he rarely touches the matching conditioner i on the other hand am not as impressed with it which is why i took off a lippie my hair is naturally pretty thick so i am not the target audience for this product for me this shampoo and conditioner made my hair more susceptible to frizz and made my hair greasier i usually like to leave a day in between washes but i would need to use pounds of dry shampoo to combat the greasies even with these downsides it is not the worst shampoo and conditioner i have used and my hair did feel healthier 
2016-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i love this shampoo around a year ago my hair started to fall horrible i went to the dermatologist and she prescribed a shampoo that contained biotin among other amazing ingridients i run out of it and didn t buy it again because it was pretty expensive but also worked wonders on my hair i searched for more afordable shampoos that contained biotin and found this one i ve been using it for about 2 weeks and my hair feels so soft shiny and hasn t been breaking like before 
2016-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i love the smell of this shampoo seriously its the best scent ever its kinda sugary smelling but as far as its quality meh it lathers thickly and nicely but its pretty drying and i dont know if its really adding any volume to my hair my hair just seems dryer and a bit frizzier after using this shampoo and accompanying conditioner its ok 
2016-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|sometimes my hair can get pretty dry unless i am using the right conditioner that works for me when i throw in organic it forsure helps to moisturize my hair taking vitamins is so important for this aspect too i take a hair skin and nails supplement that helps a lot i will always have this product as part of my hair regimen it isn t a life safer but gives my hair that extra pizzaz 
2016-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i have bought this shampoo and conditioner several times already i use it in rotation with alterna fav he moisturizing shampoo and conditioner i have think medium texture hair and i like it as big and ratty as possible this definitely helps with that while not drying out my hair it also doesn t pull out my color at all i mean no fading up to 6 weeks for the price the product is more than satisfactory a big plus is that it smells like pink sugar cotton candy love love love
2016-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i bought this shampoo recently i just cut all the colored hair i had off and am back to virgin hair i wanted to try a shampoo that wasn t for color treated hair but wanted to stay sulfate free i found the ogx line and i d heard good things i used it for the first time and the scent gave me a headache i tried it one more time and i decided i would keep using it i loved it the first few times i used it however i m starting to change my tune if i use it everyday i have this weird residue no matter how much i rinse i ve even gotten back in the shower to rinse it again but saw no change when it does dry it has little to no volume and it just sits there looking terrible now i know that you only need a tiny bit and the stuff lathers like crazy but for goodness sake i wish it would rinse clean i m going to keep using it on a rotating basis but i m not sure if i d repurchase i do want to try other formulas in this brand though 
2015-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i like this yes i understand that no shampoo will ever make my hair thicker but this one at least makes my hair look more voluminous i ran out of it but will buy it again 
2015-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|this shampoo helped my hair so much i was having issues with my hair falling out and breaking off after becoming obsessed with touching up my hair dye and leaving the dye in my hair longer and more frequent than i should have doing that to my hair caused it to break off at the roots due to the hair loss the spikes re growth baby hairs became more noticable ew not cute i watch a few youtube videos and found this line i ve been using it for 3 months now and can honestly say i see and feel a difference even my co workers have mentioned that my hair looks and feels thicker my hair has grown out so fast from when i had chopped it off last spring even the crazy spiky baby hairs have all grown out and now looks more normal around the crown of my head i m using the sea weed kelp conditioner from the same brand because the store was oos on the conditioner version of that shampoo honestly thought the conditioner itself has made my hair really soft and supple love this line i will continue using it and will explore the other options they have as well 
2015-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i just got this shampoo as gift for christmas i find the smell is really appealing feels like a treat to me i will say after you wash it completely out and your still in the shower it seems like it s left some sort of protective coating on your hair what that is i do not know good or bad i do not know i decided to say that quot yes quot i may buy it again but this is merely based on liking the scent 
2015-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|first of all let s be clear there isn t a shampoo that can actually permanently thicken your hair or make it grow it just isn t scientifically possible what it can do however is give you the appearance of thicker hair while you are using it which is just what this shampoo conditioner does that being said this shampoo amp conditioner is preventing me from cutting my hair right now i have been using it for about a week it smells delightful like cotton candy and makes my bra strap length hair look much thicker than it is i have fine hair but a lot of it i am approaching 40 and am considering cutting my hair because my ponytail width is definitely not what it used to be i love the way my hair looks when i use this and it also seems to let me stretch the time between shampoos in conjunction with a dry shampoo it is the best quot volumizing quot shampoo i have used highly recommended 
2015-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i have no complaints with this product my husband and i were traveling for a wedding across country and i forgot shampoo and conditioner i bought travel sizes of the shampoo and conditioner and fell in love immediately not only does it smell really good my hair feels thicker i now have the full sized shampoo and conditioner and will continue to use this product 
2015-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|this is a great product if you had break outs from this it s probably because of the biotin if you don t have enough water with biotin you will break out i suggest having at least 3 gallons a day
2015-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|this shampoo made my scalp itchy and break out after a couple uses i didn t notice too much of a difference in my hair either just that it now smelled like pink sugar i don t recommend it 
2015-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i actually love this brand im a bit of a soap shampoo addict it s a bit pricy but i got it on sale for 5 i think i m not super fond of the smell as it s very fruity and bath and body works smelly to me i don t like their stuff but i do like that once it s off the smell lingers i like my hair to smell lightly nice i have thick wavy curly with finer straight hair on the front right side crazy genes anyway since i have so many shampoos i like to switch it up pretty often i love the ingredients the packaging and the post shower smell it leaves my hair feeling very healthy and really clean i m sure if it bothers anybody s skin it s the added fragrance i can t say that it s made my hair stop falling out or grow or anything but i do really really like this and it s lasted me a really long time even though i use a lot at a time i recommend it if you like strongish fruity smells only i think it would work for most hair types
2015-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|bought this as i needed something for my flat hair that s been falling out i was doing research and saw that biotin is great for hair so i purchased some from boots in an offer whoop and biotin in a tablet form too but only 300ug used it for a week and my hair felt a lot stronger and more volumised but unfortunately this made me break out loads i had hairline spots all over my forehead and where i was rinsing out the shampoo i got little white head pimples on my chest i ve never had acne on my body before so i knew it was the shampoo i stopped using it immediately it took months for the pimples to go i used bio oil to help the healing process to get rid of the scarring it left behind overall it made my hair feel great but the side affects has put me off from purchasing again i ve carried on taking my biotin tablets and i don t have as many breakouts advise just check how much biotin you can take before the side affects kick in my tolerance is really low but my friend is able to take up to 2000ug her hair is freaking amazing so strong amp shiny 
2015-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i used this shampoo for about a month and did notice less hair falling out and a bit more of volume the product is very creamy and it does moisturize well it moisturized my dry frizzy hair pretty good i did not like the smell it has a musk to it that was not pleasant to me it is a bit pricey but you can catch it on sale every now and then at walgreens i love how cute the bottles are though i did use it to the very last drop but i will not be buying it again because of the smell 
2015-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|this shampoo smells great a light fruity floral fragrance it lathers well it just does not do a thing for my hair i have very fine thinning hair and i wanted this to add a little extra volume it did not add much of anything but it did cleanse well i chose this over a much cheaper volumizing shampoo that has worked for me in the past for 10 00 i will not buy this again 
2015-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|thick and full not so much i picked it up because it was sulfate free but boy oh boy does it dry my hair out it basically made my hair like dull and dead i know it s supposed to be chemical free but i don t think it s supposed to kill your hair i used up the bottle only because it was so pricey but i definitely won t be picking this one up again 
2015-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|this shampoo is just ok nothing special it s sulfate free which is good for me but it didn t have any positive effects on my hair it didn t volumize or thicken like it claims to do true it didn t strip my color but that s the only good thing i can say about it i ve used other organix shampoos with the same outcome so i ve switched to a brand i like much better shea moisture i love the manuka honey formula as well as the tahitian noni and raw shea butter formulas their masks are also excellent i particularly like the jamaican black castor oil clarifying shampoo with apple cider vinegar it smells really clean and fresh and it removes all the sticky residue from styling products and hairspray and sm poos are all sulfate free paraben and silicone free and importantly for me cruelty free so what more can you ask for sm is a bit more expensive than organix but the difference between the two is astounding sm leaves my hair soft and silky and really shiny something the oragnix shampoos never did so i don t recommend this organix poo if you want sulfate free then try sm instead 
2015-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|i bought this shampoo to give my hair some volume it did give my hair some volume but i felt that it dried out my hair in the meanwhile it smells really great and is overall a decent shampoo but i really wouldn t buy it again 
2015-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|made my hair so tangled volume was just ok nothing impressive i have achieved the same from cheap shampoos that are not moisturizing 
2015-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|ugh i can t even explain how dry this made my hair i have thin hair that s been through the ringer in the past with bad bleach jobs and dreads but this honestly made my hair feel even thinner than it already is and completely dry even after conditioning my whole head my cheap as crap herbel essences shampoo did a better job i bought it because of the reviews on here and the fact that so many people said it smelled like the fragrance pink sugar i didn t really find that it did at all or at least it s not noticeable enough to care for it it wasn t cheap either i think it s overpriced and way overhyped i always seen girls post pictures from this line on to instagram but i haven t really had good experiences with any of their products i have tried so far honestly it was a waste of money and it s probably going to end up under my bathroom sink with the rest of my crappy products lol 
2015-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo|my mom purchased this for me and my sister we have stick straight hair so she thought this shampoo and conditioner would help me and her i did notice a difference in my hair after the first wash my hair felt more bouncy the thing i didn t like about this product is the smell mine smelt very smoky like cigarettes i read other reviews saying it smells like the perfume called pink sugar which i love but mine didn t smell like that maybe i got a defective bottle 
2021-01|1.0|Deeply Restoring Pracaxi Recovery Shampoo|garbage shampoo never in my life have i experienced what this shampoo did to my hair this shampoo dried out my hair into a straw like texture to the point that i started developing these odd tangles and knot clumps at the back of my head that i needed to tediously take care for fear of ripping my hair out also holy itchy scalp so itchy all this is not normal behaviour for my hair texture especially as this went away the moment i switched to another shampoo i researched into this ogx brand and they ve had lawsuits against them in the past for misleading product claims quel surprise never again 
2021-01|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|my absolute favourite conditioner has just been discontinued so i gave this one a try admittedly i didn t put much thought into the purchase but it claimed to do the same as the conditioner i was replacing so i gave it a go my first thought was that i didn t like it at all the scent was so strong and unusual but then i got out of the shower and styled my hair and wow we have a winner when i pair this with the matching shampoo and use them in reverse order i really love the results my hair s now thicker softer and i have way less hair fall if this also cured my frizzies it would be a home run 
2020-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|in frame is ogx thick and full biotin and collagen shampoo and conditioner contents vitamin b7 biotin collagen and hydrolysed wheat protein vitamin b7 biotin infuses nutrients to every strand of hair collagen has a plumping action and adds more volume to your hair hydrolyzed wheat protein is an amber colored liquid derived from wheat germ it thickens and adds volume to thinning hair and adds shine to your hair it s a sulfate free shampoo and can be used on all hair types net vol 385 ml price both the products cost rs 725 each personlly it worked for me because i was having a lot of hair fall and this combination reduced my hair fall and also restored my hair s volume ratings 5 5
2017-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i m surprised by the bad reviews i rotate between this and the pantene daily moisture renewal this conditioner has an amazing smell and always leaves my hair super soft and moisturized i love it i just wish it was cheaper i am going to repurchase soon because i just ran out of it edit i use the suave avocado and olive oil and the suave keratin smoothing conditioners now they are way better and cheaper i moved it down to 4 lippies 
2016-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i m so surprised by all of the negative reviews perhaps the majority of people reviewing have straight fine thin hair my hair however is thick and curly 3a mostly some 3b for reference and i wear it straight most of the time i don t get greasy hair easily i randomly picked this up at the drugstore as i had run out of conditioner and i ve had generally good experiences with organix i wasn t expecting anything more than a decent conditioner and a nice fragrance boy was i surprised as hell now i don t really need more thick and full hair my hair usually falls a little flat after i straighten it but not after this conditoner i conditioned with this twice the first time for about 5 minutes the second time for maybe two hours i then rinsed let my hair dry in a cotton shirt then brushed my curls out carefully my hair was so easy to brush out my curls weren t frizzy at all no tangles and they looked super healthy the biggest surprise came while i was blow drying my hair straight with a round brush amazing i normally don t give a shit when i m using a blow dryer but my hair which normally looked untamed and therefore required a hot iron afterward looked totally gorgeous and voluminous i still haven t gone over it with a flat iron and i never would skip the smoothing wonders of my iron now my hair is soft smells good and has a really nice almost dare i say it salon like style to it totally unheard of for me give it a try this conditioner worked really well for me and i definitely recommend to all my curly haired lovelies out there plus it s what 8 it s worth a try for sure 
2016-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i love this conditioner i have pretty straight fine hair that curls a little at the ends and i guess it s a little wavy but it is pretty flat so i tend to look for things that will add volume and thickness to it this does that and also my my hair very soft and shiny it doesn t leave my hair oily at all 
2016-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i was given this conditioner by a fellow fine haired lass for whom it didn t work she warned me it might weigh my hair down as it had hers but i decided to try it anyway well it did weigh my hair down but i love the scent it reminds me of aquolina pink sugar which i wore years ago and so made it work by using it for reverse washing and rotating it with other products i finished my mostly full bottle organix should either reformulate this to make it work for fine hair or market it for hardier hair types but definitely keep the delicious scent did i mention that it lingers for a couple days i dig it but you might not i didn t buy this but organix products are on the pricey side for drugstore hair products 8 a bottle though they re often on sale still i may get it again just for the scent 
2016-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i m surprised by the bad rating this conditioner is pretty decent i have long puffy wavy hair and this tames it it s not an amazing conditioner or anything but for the price and the fact that it doesn t test on animals i d buy this conditioner again 
2016-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|great smelling product i always feel like i need to put so much in my hair though and it never feels very conditioning my hair is a bit hard to brush through after using this and the shampoo i havent noticed much volume added either my hair is overall a bit drier and frizzier its just ok 
2016-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i love this product i use both shampoo and conditioner a low carb diet caused my thick waist length hair to thin and break off to my shoulders needing specialized treatment i was using a 3 step salon treatment for 6 months which brought my hair back as well as proper diet and supplements when the time came to go back to a more normal shampoo i read the reviews on this and gave it a try honestly it s working even better than the salon product i m delighted my hair is super thick soft silky and growing fast i have already brought replacement bottles so i don t run out it may not work like this for everyone but my hair loves it i look like me again now great product 
2016-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i don t know why are there so many bad reviews i love this product my curly hair is growing like crazy it actually works i recommend this and i love how it smells is just great 
2015-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i reaally wanted to love this biotin collagen great scent but kinda leaning towards more of quot meh quot i have crazy full hair wavy curly amp frizzy thanks to the cold weather in the north doesn t feel that great even right after applying can t get anything out of this without 2 3 leave in conditioners not going to re purchase this 
2015-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i did not like this conditioner at all the smell is nice it doesn t drive me crazy but it s just bearable you know however this did nothing for my hair except leave it dry and my roots got oily super fast thanks to this not to mention my ends were super coarse ew 
2015-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i did not like the conditioner one bit it has a musky smell to it and the conditioner itself is very thick it was kind of hard to get it out of the bottle after applying it it made my dry frizzy hair feel very greasy and weighed down i prefer to use the shampoo and use a different conditioner i will not be purchasing again because of the smell and the fact that it did the opposite of adding thickness and volume to my hair 
2015-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i m saddened by the bad reviews because i really do love this conditioner i switched to this set when the tresemme volume set made my hair fall out and the conditioner left my hair stringy and dry the organix shampoo fell way short of amazing the conditioner however is a winner i have super long almost waist length hair that is kinda wavy and that i never brush after showering cause it just looks awkward and frizzy my ends are dry and prone to breakage and this conditioner is wonderful i apply it starting at the hair below my ears around the nape of my neck and leave it in for 3 5 minutes in the shower i don t brush and honestly don t really need to cause it s never tangled my ends look super nourished and every since i stopped using the shampoo of this set my ends don t look over saturated with any ick or anything either i shower at night and sleep on my hair wet and this conditioner somehow sets my hair into super soft waves and it feels sooooo soft despite my praises i can see why this couldn t work with someone who has oily hair it would definitely leave a coating on the hair shaft so if you re looking for a conditioner to combat dry broken ends i highly recommend this one not just cause it s great by the 13 oz bottle lasts a lot longer than expected
2014-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|while i love the organix biotin amp collagen shampoo this conditioner falls flat the consistency is too thin and it simply doesn t make my hair feel any softer 
2014-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|this left a lot of buildup and made my hair look limp but matted definitely the worst conditioner i have tried from the line it does smell good to my nose and softens well but i will have to pass on this plus i m glad i only bought the travel size i really wanted to like this but will have to pass on to my sister to see if she might like it better oh well 
2014-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i was able to get this in the tall bottle along with the shampoo also tall bottle for 10 it seemed like a steal at the time so i caved in before this the only organix products i ve bought was the leave in spray i wanted to like this at first i was amazed with how soft my hair was out of the shower my boyfriend even liked how my hair smelled while it is moisturizing for the hair i feel like it might be a bit much with other shampoo amp conditioners i was able to wait till day 3 for my hair to get super oily but with this it happens at the end of day one if i were to try day 2 hair i d have to use a dry shampoo i also feel like this weighs down my hair which is isn t nice for me it s nice because it causes my wavy hair to be straighter but at the same time my roots are also weighed down so my hair doesn t have any volume to it if this wouldn t weigh down my hair so much and i wouldn t get oily so easily i d love it 2 23 15update i ve figured a way to make this work i put a bunch of the shampoo in use the middle of my fingers to massage my scalp and them rub my ends between my hands like you would rub your hands together when you re cold i ve stopped heavily scrubbing and now use a large tooth comb too on my wet hair my hair is silky with this it s still lacking on 2nd day hair and i want to try some of their other products to see if i can get a bit more volume 
2014-08|2.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i think i have to be done with organix hair products i bought this and the matching shampoo and for some reason they make my hair completely flyaway and full of static i tried using the shampoo only with a different conditioner and had the same problem it s only when i stopped using them both that the static went away i also don t really like the smell of this product it s kind of powdery i will say that the conditioner detangles pretty well which is always a problem for me but because of the static problem i m only using it to coat my ends when i shampoo and then use another conditioner after shampooing and i am using the corresponding shampoo to wash my delicates in the washing machine 
2014-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i have fine hair and i ve tried volumizing conditioners before and they left my hair frizzy i decided to try this since it claims to make it full it s an ok conditioner it gives plenty of slip and can easily comb through my hair wet but it s super heavy and builds up after 2 days by the third day my hair looked matted and had a lot of static from the build up will use it once in a while but not everyday 
2013-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|absolutely horrid i was left extremely disappointed by this conditioner in the shower it detangled my hair like a dream and it felt like it was going to be a winner but once i started to blow dry my hair i ended up with the worst knots and tangles i ve ever had this is going straight in the trash can after just one use my roots were left tacky waxy and greasy while my ends were left looking damaged and frizzy i like the matching shampoo but highly suggest skipping out on the conditioner 
2013-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|bought this as a set with the shampoo smells great but it s a terrible conditioner it felt jelly like and wouldn t rinse out well then realised its because it has silicones and there must be a lot left my hair feeling limp this is going in the bin 
2013-08|1.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|cute packaging and smells extremely good but did nothing for my fine limp hair 
2013-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|this shampoo and conditioner set makes my hair suuuper thick and full however one downside is that it does build up after a while due to the silicones it has to counter this use an apple cider vinegar rinse every week or so it ll remove build up and make your hair really shiny it s easily one of my favorite shampoo and conditioner sets i highly recommend i only gave it four lippies for the build up 
2013-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i bought this product for my fine hair i must say for the first couple weeks my hair had lots of volume the smell of this product is great and i have always loved this company s packaging after about 3 weeks my hair all of a sudden started becoming greasy and limp i continued to use it with no improvement i ended up throwing the remainder away 
2013-08|3.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner| update this formula does build up quite a bit after 2 weeks of continuous use my hair was heavy and stringy once a week i use a clarifying shampoo and let my hair rest the thickening effect is really great and i still think it s worth it for occasions i just wish it was less heavy on silicones overall seems like a great thickening conditioner the smell is very similar to the sensual amber line from bath amp body works very warm and comforting i find that this gave my baby fine hair a lot of body and shininess and it was easier to comb out while wet without tugging very happy with it so far it looks like i overpaid it was 7 99 at walgreen s the formula is concentrated so this bottle should last a while will update after using a whole bottle to see if the magic lasts 
2013-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|the thing i love the most is the smell so nice and leaves my hair so soft easy to brush and reveals your natural waves just perfect for me 
2013-08|5.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|love it it makes my hair feel so soft and brushing is much easier it smells a little odd but the scent fades quickly i wish i could purchase a larger bottle as this product is relatively expensive for its size 6 at target 
2013-08|4.0|Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner|i bought this conditioner along with the matching shampoo at target for less than 6 apiece this is a great thickening conditioner like i mentioned in the shampoo review i didn t like the scent of this line almost cigar like but it delivers thick shiny healthy looking hair my hair is manageable with no tangles after i use this conditioner with the matching shampoo you only need a tiny bit of the conditioner so i imagine this bottle will last a long time it s also moisturizing so if you have fine hair like i do a little goes a long way 
2020-11|3.0|Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo|i m not totally sold on this product it doesn t smell as good as the other coconut stuff from ogx it s an ok dry shampoo my hair is long and thick and tends to get oily at the roots within 2 days of washing this does a decent job absorbing the greasiness without weighing my hair down or looking like dust on my dark hair it s not as good as batiste and doesn t smell half as good as the coconut batiste scent actually if this smelled better i would like it a lot more but the smell is just kind of off putting to me 
2019-08|5.0|Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo|best drugstore dry shampoo ive tried and i ve tried a lot i have fine hair that tends to get oily 12 hours after i shower so dry shampoo is my ultimate savior this one has to be my fave because it actually smells nice it really collects the oil and while it still can give a bit of chalky residue it s nothing compared to most of the drugstore brands out there tip dry shampoo at night by morning there will be no white residue and your hair will be big fluffy and oil free 
2020-11|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|it s an affordable shampoo considering that it s great the scent is lovely not too strong though it cleans well i like the fact that it s sulfate free one thing is that it can dry out the hair so i advise anyone who uses this to use a good conditioner with it it s definitely worth the money 
2020-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|somehow and someway this helps reduce the amount of hair falling when i wash my hair although to a lesser degree than other products i ve used in the past i use this twice a week as i prefer not to wash my hair too often and follow with the coconut milk conditioner the shampoo itself is a lovely pearlescent color and the aroma is simply gorgeous very coconut y and quite strong although it doesn t last for long on my hair once it s been blow dried used in conjunction with the conditioner my hair does not end up frizzy or dry like it does with most hair products but shiny soft and manageable even my hairdresser commented when i went in for a haircut recently my only gripe is the bottle when it s nearing the end i can t stand it upside down to get the last of it out because of the rounded cap propping it up between my soap dish and the corner of my shower it topples over regardless of how careful i am verdict works for me but not quite as effective or strong enough on hair loss to purchase a bottle specifically for that purpose however for cleansing and frizz control this is brilliant and i will repurchase selena x my top 10 hg list as i ve tried 100 s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti aging serum divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference 
2019-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i like the smell of this however you need so much product to get a lather and since this product has coconut oil you can breakout if it drips on your face 
2018-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|the only thing i liked about this was the fragrance which is lovely and lingers i ll use this up eventually as a now and then body wash but would not use on my hair again or repurchase it was hard to lather and unimpressive often left my hair dry and straw like nothing about this felt quot nourishing quot in the least 
2018-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|ive been trying out new shampoos since my pregnancy i was having nausea so i couldnt use this but i loveeee this scent when i am not pregnant lol smells like waffles since having the baby ive been experiencing hair loss and i had to come back to this this is the shampoo i trust and will always come back to i used to like herbal essences but it made my hair so greasy the i love juicy shampoo from lush is great but its expensive and it was very drying i also hate hate the love beauty planet ones the tee trea and vetiver one made me bald and soooo itchy i was losing double amount of hair i usually experience in the shower so here we are my tried and true i love the smell and how it doesnt make my hair feel like its stripping all its moisture it also lathers so nicely and i dont experience the terrible scary hair loss the best part is that i dont get as greasy as the herbal essence i think its because its not stripping of moisture so my scalp isnt compensating in making more oil i dont really care for the conditioner because i love my shae moisture coconut fruit weightless mask so good i do not get itchy from this and just one wash i can tell a difference of how much my hair loves this shampoo i have straight long asian hair thats med thick this is the best ive tried in the drugstore edit after 3 bottles of this i bought the large bottle i am still using this and will continue to i even got my bf to use this its none greasy and non drying its the happy medium that i look for in a shampoo i love the smell and i never get tired of it i also use the coconut milk anti breakage serum and coconut curl hair butter as a leave in conditioner and just in love with all things coconut by ogx

2018-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|a few years ago there was a bit of a hullabaloo over sulphates in shampoos as well as silicones and parabens in conditioners it has to be said that a lot of the evidence suggesting these ingredients are bad for us is of poor quality and questionable validity however i did go through a period where i had colour treated hair with a demi permanent dye wella s colour touch and the colour would fade super fast with run of the mill shampoos with lauryl and laureth sulphate compounds and the advice at the time was to try sulphate free tried a variety of products baby shampoo super expensive salon brands like kerastase kind natured shampoos naked shampoos and was underwhelmed by all of them this shampoo is a little unusual as it has a jelly like texture something common to a lot of organix shampoos and does take a bit of work to lather effectively i have oily fine porous hair and shampooing once wouldn t remove oil effectively but a second shampoo and rinse would do the trick the good thing was that it did extend the life of the colourant on my hair before it needed re doing so there was that in combination with the coconut conditioner used on hair ends it was shinier and softer but now that i ve returned to having un dyed hair i can t really justify using a shampoo that i have to use up twice as fast so that my hair is clean overall i don t think this is a terrible product and it s worth a try if you want to extend wear time of semi permanent or demi permanent hair dyes i no longer use the shampoo but i do still use the coconut conditioner from this brand 1 lipstick for the packaging as i absolutely hate the shape of these bottles they are so so bad and i can t believe organix still uses these things when the bottle is nearing empty it s such hard work to get the last bits out because the shampoo is so viscous and jelly like and the bottles can t be stood upside down i d recommend decanting it into a cheap squeezy travel bottle instead 
2017-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|this shampoo didnt work for me it didnt clean well it left my hair greasy and flat i ve tried a couple products from this brand and none have worked for me my hair is blonde wavy dry and often frizzy it s fine but i have a lot of it color treated 
2017-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|great product for oily hair i am constantly on the hunt for hair products that will efficiently remove oil from my scalp but still be nourishing enough to keep my scalp from becoming overly dry and irritated which can cause it to go oily this product really does it for me with this product i only have to shampoo my hair once per wash and it leaves my scalp oil free but nourishes enough to leave my scalp calm without weighing my hair down oh and it smells great too it really smells like sugary coconut i don t have any negative thing to say about this product although i do find the price to be a little higher than the usual drugstore shampoos have been repurchasing this product for over a year now 
2017-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i have normal asian color treated hair no issues i used the shampoo and conditioner for maybe two years it was okay but my hair became a bit drier and harder to detangle i would just use the clairol nice n easy conditioner tube that came with the box of dye when it got unmanageable i kept buying it because i liked the scent and the lather while washing i haven t really found a replacement tried aussie moist shampoo and conditioner my hair loved the aussie but after three weeks my scalp started to itch so still searching for an everyday shampoo 
2016-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i really wanted to love this but even with the conditioner my hair was much frizzier than usual and i have straight hair it didn t detangle well out of the shower maybe this would work for a guy with shorter hair who doesn t need a product to actually perform and just likes the smell lol
2016-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|this shampoo left my hair dry knotted and full of tangles maybe it had too much protein for my hair or maybe it s just a crappy shampoo 
2016-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|absolutely love this it smells amazing and makes my hair feel so soft whilst it isn t the cheapest shampoo i have purchased many bottles of it it leaves my hair feeling smooth shiny and deeply cleaned i thought i would never be able to achieve that just washed by a hair dresser clean and smooth feeling you get after going to a hair salon this isn t the exact same nothing i have used is but it comes so close would recommend to anyone who loves a coconut scent and shiny smooth clean hair 
2016-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|it was a good product i found that my hair becomes shinier and smoother however it leaves scalps on my hair and according to my friend she said it was because the main ingredient is coconut oil which created this in general i like it but i would like to try another type of this brand 
2016-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|smells great like coconut cream pie unfortunately like the other reviewers it left my hair dry and full of tangles i am now using the coconut milk conditioner as a shave gel for my legs it works great in that regard 
2016-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|like the other reviewers i wanted to live this product i use the body lotion and wanted the whole line smelled nice without being overpowering lathered up nicely even minus the sulfates seemed ok at first but after a few weeks i noticed my hair was dry and the ends felt like straw and i use a leave in conditioner i have dry hair to begin with so maybe if you have oily hair it would tone down the oil because it does seem to take the moisture out of the hair over time live their lotion the shampoo and conditioner not so much 
2016-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i was in high hopes for this quot organic quot product and because of the price and the smell i wanted to love this product unfortunately it dried out my hair and after a few weeks i noticed my hair started falling out in clumps and in combination with organix conditioner both coconut and argon oil no amount of conditioner would soften my hair i couldn t even get a pick through my baby fine hair huge disappointment going back to the salon brands for sure 
2016-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|when i bought this product i loved the smell and i thought this shampoo was going to help the dryness and frizziness in my hair unfortunately when i washed my hair with this shampoo my hair became knotty unruly and dry not a product i want to use again 
2016-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i bought a travel sized container of this and love it i m going to get the 13 ounce bottle of it it makes my hair soft and shiny it s also helping me get rid of my itchy scalp i was expecting the coconut smell to linger a bit more though 
2016-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i like the coconut milk scent but i actually hate this shampoo and conditioner my hair looks really frizzy compared to the other ones i ve tried 
2015-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|this made my hair dry i thought it would have the opposite effect but i was wrong it also made my scalp really dry which i ve never had a problem with before flakes were on my shoulders amp i freaked out 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|for a while i d been suffering with a really itchy flakey scalp and after doing some research i decided to try a sulphate free shampoo i think that most if not all the organix shampoos and conditioners are sls free but i went with the coconut milk just because i love the smell i found it easy to use and wash out it lathers up fine despite being sls free my itchy scalp seems to have gone for now and i have my fingers crossed that it stays away 
2015-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|after having used the yes to cucumbers shampoo as my sls free shampoo for the past couple of months my hair was feeling rather dry besides that a hairdresser completely messed up my hair recently leaving it damaged and brittle and not in the color i wanted because i color my hair and want to do my best to keep the color as solid as possible so i don t have to make as many trips to the salon i was looking for a new sls free shampoo and soon enough my attention was drawn to the line of ogx shampoos a bit pricey but still lower priced than your standard salon shampoos i decided to look up some reviews online and the opinions on ogx shampoos were very mixed the coconut milk seemed to be the highest rated shampoo out of the bunch as desperate as i was for a new shampoo i decided to bite the bullet and bought this shampoo anyways the pros and the cons the pros has a very pleasant coconut scent that leaves your shower smelling nice produces quite a lot of lather for an sls free shampoo i didn t need a lot of product for my rather long hair so i think the bottle could last me quite a while the cons it takes a lot of work to rinse this out properly and it s hard to feel when the product is completely washed out of your hair so it s hard to tell if you ve rinsed well enough this did nothing for my roots scalp but made the ends of my hair very greasy i find this odd because the ends of my hair are usually quite dry normally i d wash my hair every 3 to 4 days while using this shampoo i have to wash my hair every day every other day this is a huge con for me because i don t like greasy hair and i don t like washing it often because i don t want my color to fade too quick conclusion i should ve listened to the negative reviews and so should you potential buyer don t buy this shampoo there are lots of better shampoos on the market for a better price this stuff weighs your hair down and makes it greasy i don t want a shampoo to make my hair greasy i want a shampoo to gently clean my hair sorry ogx but this shampoo is a disappointment 
2015-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i am asian and my hair is long fine and stick straight with zero volume it gets oily and limp quickly although my ends dry out easily my hair is relatively healthy and i don t use heat or styling products in it there are a lot of mixed reviews here and i was scared to purchase but i figured i could return it in case it doesn t work out for me the smell alone was enough for me to purchase it it smells so so good not like artificial coconuts but like a creamy delicious authentic coconut the scent is light but lingers in my hair my boyfriend can smell it only when his face is buried in my hair so it isn t overwhelming and won t clash with your perfume the shampoo gives my locks the hydration it needs without weighing them down a lot of people say their hair feels like straw but i regularly use clarifying shampoos lush seanik lush big and this is no where near as close to drying as those it is a really great daily shampoo if you have oily roots and dry ends in conjunction with the conditioner the price is as good when you can find it on sale and i will definitely be repurchasing 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i started using it by buying the mini ones when i went on vacation and i loved the smell i have dry hair and it makes my hair soft and smooth and make it smell amazing the price can be expensive but you can get it cheap at target xoxo
2015-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i bought this with the matching conditioner i don t know why i despise coconut scented anything that being said i was desperate as my hair was just too frizzy and out of control i have always read that coconut is really good for dry hair this morning i eagerly washed and conditioned my hair praying despite the cloying scent that this would be my savior by the end of the day i was back to the store i purchased these products from waiting in the return line i was sick to my stomach from the cloying scent i decided i would rather live with frizzy hair than to continue to smell that sweet coconut scent every time i turned my head i purchased another shampoo and conditioner i ran home to wash my hair hoping the new products would wash the sweet coconut scent out i washed 2x and i can t get it out never again this stuff is just disgustingly stink 
2015-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|made my hair brittle and dry 
2015-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|it s very strange to me that this has such low ratings i have tried many shampoo conditioner combos the ogx biotin ogx argan oil loreal suave dove pantene etc but i always come back to this i just bought my third bottle yesterday this stuff has no sulfates so it doesn t lather very well but it still gets my hair clean the scent is very nice and it lingers i have fine medium thick wavy hair and this works like a charm to make it thick and shiny and soft i use this with the matching conditioner and i honestly couldn t ask for a better pair that s as affordable and convenient as this one i bought a 19 5 oz bottle at target for only 5 79 
2015-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i love organix i really do this shampoo seemed like a good idea at first i used it in conjunction with the conditioner and it did make my hair look nice however and this is the kicker it made my face chest and back break out in extremely bad acne it has been over a month since i stopped using it and my pores are still not unclogged this is due to the coconut oil in it which is one of the most comodogenic oils out there 
2015-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i have tried other organix products and this is the third shampoo i have tried from organix i tried the organix brazilian keratin organix renewing moroccan argan oil shampoo my husband and i went to harmon this weekend i was running out of my shampoo and i need to restock i did my research and i decided to purchase the coconut milk shampoo conditioner spray and anti breakage serum i love this line my husband actually purchased the shampoo conditioner and spray for me i purchased the anti breakage serum at cvs only because harmon did not have it in stock i love harmon for their everyday low prices and their selection as well i love this shampoo the packaging the smell the actual product is sulfate free and works well i have thick wavy hair and it cleaned my hair but did not strip it i did use the conditioner spray and anti breakage serum they work well together and a little goes s long way also harmon has the 13oz size for 5 99 as well as the conditioner spray and serum the large size of shampoo and conditioner is 25 4 oz and is 10 99 i know it sounds like a lot but these products are a great quality like salon quality ata fraction of the price oragnix is available at most drugstores and supermarkets including target and walmart but for me harmon has the best everyday prices 
2015-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|smells amazing but makes my hair look like crap i have frizzy hair and this makes it greasy and flat which is a remarkable feat onto itself would definitely never buy this again 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i ve been using this shampoo on and off forever it smells like heaven and the scent lingers on your hair this is sulfate too so it doesn t dry out my hair the only downside to this is the price i pay 6 dollars for a 13 oz bottle of this so i don t use this every time washing this shampoo is great for occasions i like my hair is smell extra nice 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|first time organix user i spent a lot of time wondering about this product i read a lot of reviews and finally bought as it was on sale at my local superstore along with the conditioner i d heard reviews of people noticing less hair loss and i noticed it too with the previous shampoo conditioner combo i was using i experienced a fair amount of hair loss breakage now next to none the scent is nice i m in love with a lot of stuff coconut and it s not overpowering i actually use the coconut water hydration oil if i want a little burst of scent i also love how much more nourished and stronger my hair seems my biggest flaws are the price anywhere from 6 11 depending where i go and if it s on sale and the fact that the bottles don t show how much is left if i have the money i d definitely repurchase i love how my hair feels afterwards 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|this is my second use and i love it my hair looks shiny and smell like a heaven finger cross hope this is the great shampoo i have found finally i tried more expensive brands before i think this is better 
2015-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i bought this review because i really like coconut oil i was hoping that it would give my fine blonde hair some much needed moisture i bought both the shampoo and conditioner and used them as directed i was so disappointed they actually dried out my hair and it wasn t moisturizing at all i tried using them the next time i washed my hair and had the same results returned the product immediately maybe it was just my hair type but i definitely wouldn t recommend using this product to a friend 
2015-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|this is the only shampoo i can use at the moment i m going through a difficult phase of post partum hair loss and my hair is still very dry it can get quite dry during pregnancy i ve tried lots of shampoos conditioners and styling products and every time my hair was limp dry and frizzy the volumizing products only seemed to add some stickiness to it so things were getting a bit desperate until i found this it cleans well although i find i need to apply it twice for a good clean and most importantly adds volume texture and moisture to my hair i don t need to use a conditioner and a few drops of hair oil any are enough to get rid of most of the frizz also it smells nice and not too strong the difference is remarkable when i try other shampoos as my hair goes back to being flat and shapeless i m very glad i picked it out randomly it s a bit of a lottery with ogx shampoos there are so many to choose from i will keep repurchasing 
2015-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|this and the conditioner are just ok it does fine and the conditioner is pretty moisturizing but it s nothing special and i have found plenty of products that work much better for half the price will finish using what i have but will probably not re purchase 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i had this shampoo and the conditioner in the back of my bathroom cabinet last time i had used it was when i still had very long hair it didn t do anything for me back then and it quietly found it s place between all the other discarded shampoos amp conditioners yesterday i was watching essie button s march favorites video and she mentioned this and as my hair is only slightly longer than hers i thought i could give it a try again back when my hair was long i hated that it didn t moisturize enough and that it left my hair course but now with my lob it is perfect it makes my hair soft but not weighed down i actually can blow dry it and create volume without the use of an additional styling product this shampoo and conditioner have made it out of exile and have taken up residence in my shower 
2015-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i loved this product at first but now i absolutely hate it it costs me a 16 for a bottle first of all it smells great just like coconut but doesn t last really long i have thin and dry hair this shampoo weights my hair down and makes it look greasy the consistency is thick but not moisturising enough for my hair overall i hate it
2015-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|this review is the same as the conditioner from the same line as i always use both together i m doing a combined review meh that s all i got to say in my experience it s not as bad as other reviewers are saying but it s not a good product either i love the smell smells like sweet coconut and not the beachy salty coconut smell of sunscreen but the smell doesn t linger in my hair i used the conditionner and the shampoo together for a while and my hair felt ok they were not really nourished by this product 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|personally it s too expensive to buy again but that s the only reason i like the smell and it cleans which is its purpose it also doesn t make my fine straight super short hair feel like straw which is always a plus it makes my hair look very healthy i find that it cleans quite feel without letting hair get too oily or dry it does its job 
2015-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i felt the texture was really thick it wasn t easy using it in the shower you have to squeeze hard to get product out so this isn t my favorite one in the line i am not a huge fan of coconut smell either so this was just ok for me i prefer the blue one the morrocan argan one 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i really like this shampoo because it is lightweight and moisturizing and works well on my dry hair i also love the scent and it lingers on my hair i really want to try other shampoos from this brand to see which one is better but i like that these shampoos are quite clean and don t have any parabens paraffines or silicone in them i really like this product 
2015-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i really like this here s why it doesn t make my hair soft at all it makes it quite dry but that was what i was expecting it s not the job s shampoo to make your hair soft that s just not gonna happen shampoo cleans your hair and that could be quite drying if doesn t make it dry then it isn t cleaning it properly and it would become greasy in a day but this shampoo brings my hair back to life it s made it shiny and stronger and for some reason blonder i have a few blonde highlights that were just dead and grody and this shampoo brought them back from the dead the trick with this is don t use the matching conditioner because it sucks it s runny and watery and your hair will be dry i use this with dove s oil therapy conditioner and my hair s been loving it it too has coconut oil in it and it s quite moisturizing so my hair is silky and smooth all day and it takes about four days for it to become greasy 
2014-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i was very disappointed in this product compared to the other organic shampoo and hair products that i have used previously this shampoo was very thick for my hair i have slightly thick hair unless straightened and while i thoroughly was it out the next day i would constantly find flaky bits of shampoo stuck to the strands at the top of my scalp the shampoo does not lather up and is a very thick consistency most of the time making it hard to squeeze out of the bottle it also left my scalp and the ends of my hair feeling very dry and brittle i used the shampoo in conjunction with the matching conditioner which again i was not thrilled about and the coconut milk serum and the coconut spray which are amazing i still use these however the shampoo and conditioner do nothing for my hair and leave it very dry and brittle i will not buy this product again very disappointed as the other shampoos that i have tried from this range are amazing however this formula just does not work for my hair 
2014-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|this product is alright although the smell is amazing the actual product is pretty mediocre it has a very strange consistency similar to jello but it doesn t really bother me i ve found it lathers pretty well and i get it at walmart for about 5 which isn t bad to me at least it didn t leave my hair greasy it actually felt pretty clean but after a few washes it didn t clean my hair as well and my hair would get very oily super easy i have pretty long about rib length hair that s naturally blonde it s pretty thick but i have fine hair so i have a lot of hair but it s indivual strands aren t super thick does that make sense anyways this shampoo is okay but i probably wouldn t purchase it again if organix is reading this just know if my hair had that scent after it was dry i wouldn t care how the product was i would use it everyday just so i could smell my hair all day so maybe work on the longevity of the smell if anything lmao
2014-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i was looking to invest in a good shampoo that would treat my hair right i have fine short color treated hair this shampoo didn t do anything for my hair the scent is just in the bottle when you sniff the shampoo besides that your hair will not smell like that after showering with this product i have to apply this shampoo twice on my hair in order to get any bubbles or feel like its washing my hair for all they hype of this brand its overpriced for sure i mean the bottle looks chic but that s about it 
2014-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i love this shampoo honestly i mostly buy it for the wonderful coconut smell but i also think it s a pretty good quality shampoo i usually use this during warm weather months it doesn t magically change my hair or anything but it s definitely not a bad product 
2014-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|the worst shampoo i think i ve used in the past couple of years i picked this up at costco because i wanted a sulfate free shampoo that would last me a while i decided on this because hey coconut smells nice this did nothing except ruin my hair it s really thick and while it builds a nice lather it doesn t really clean my hair my hair feels thick and sludgy hard to comb through and feels like it has a film on it that makes it feel sticky it also makes my curls totally flat dry and frizzy also the smell is so strong it stays in my hair for days and i can t stand it it honestly has no redeeming qualities i ll never use this stuff again 
2014-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i have fine straight hair and i live currently in a desert dry area this shampoo moisturizes my hair wonderfully and makes it silky smooth however i find it strange that when i tried this in the summer i didn t like it on 2nd day hair it would leave my hair flat and the fragrance of the shampoo would disappear leaving my hair feeling and smelling dirty however now in the winter perhaps cus it s drier weather and i don t have as much heat sweat oil in my hair this shampoo allows my hair to still feel just as nice as the first day coconut smell in my hair is not my favorite scent but because it moisturizes my hair in the winter very well for me i will repurchase 
2014-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|not as good as expected
2014-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i had really high hopes for this shampoo but i ve been using it for a month now and its just terrible for my scalp it gave me bothersome itchy and flaky scalp and trust me i shampoo my hair very well leaving no trace of it so it would make more sense if i didn t have itchiness but unfortunately i did it smells really nice and does moisturize my hair and leaves it soft in the same day but the next day i start to get an itchy scalp the conditioner i would rate as a 4 5 it is so nice and i will continue to use that one it s very thick and i use it as a deep conditioner too 
2014-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i really like this shampoo i have somewhat damaged very fine and oily hair i have been using this product every day without any conditioner it is a very thick clear to white jelly substance since it is very thick you might end up using a bit more than you need so do be careful about that it smells just like the bottle indicates like coconut heaven it does contain real coconut milk coconut oil and also egg whites it is also sulphate free this shampoo definitely leaves my hair feeling a lot softer shinier and overall a lot healthier my hair is also easier to comb through after using this shampoo price point isn t bad it ranges from six to nine dollars for thirteen ounces it is available in drug stores and even grocery stores as well so it is very accessible i like it and would repurchase 
2014-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i wanted to write a review on this product because i see so many bad reviews today i tried out this shampoo to spot wash my bangs wich is the most greasy part of my hair i was plesently suprised that my bangs came out decently clean and silky smooth i think this shampoo is great for fine medium full hair that needs to be tamed down a little bit however for best results i dont think conditioner needs to be used with it and i also think that its a good idea to have a second shampoo thats less heave to swich back an fourth form but overall i belive this is a good product
2014-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|if it wasn t for the smell of this shampoo i probably wouldn t buy it its not my favourite shampoo by a long way but i always seem to have it in my bathroom i m very fussy about scents and most shampoos amp conditioners are not to my taste but this one smells so nice this shampoo is strange sometimes i ll wash my hair and it will feel amazing and sometimes it makes my hair feel dry and rough i don t understand why but i do love the scent so i will keep a bottle just to sniff
2014-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i really wanted it to work i loveeeeeeeeeeeeee the coconut smell but after three times of giving it a shot i realized it was hopeless it left my hair dry frizzy tangled and lifeless it also has this rubbery type of feel to it the kind when i bleached my hair i m utterly disappointed they should totally make a body fragrance though 
2014-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|for starters my hair is massive long and red imagine princess merida it is very dry and is quite coarse i was on the hunt for a good moisturizing shampoo to tame my mane and i had heard great things about the organix line i gave this shampoo a try because a friend recommended this to me and i liked the scent very beachy like a pina colada i gave it and the conditioner counterpart a try for a month and was not impressed at all it did not quot nourish quot like it claimed to left my hair oily and not clean at all and altogether it didn t live up to any of the claims it made i do not recommend this to anyone 
2014-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|so many bad reviews for this product but it s my new holy grail i must have the type of hair it works best with my hair is long very fine straight prone to oily roots and very dry ends after a botched color job a year ago my hair is so damaged and easy to tangle at the ends i tried everything professional salon brands deep conditioners protein treatments nothing worked combining this shampoo with the keratin oil conditioner has left me with the silkiest healthiest hair i ve had in a long time all the way down to the ends lathers well in hard water which we have rinses clean without stripping a shampoo isn t going to really provide moisturizing like a conditioner but this maintains it well from day to day i ve found my new holy grail 
2014-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|smells good but not good to my hair this was not nearly conditioning enough and my hair was very tangled and stringy looking it also didn t appear very clean after washing with this i do love the tea tree line but only the scent as it does nothing for my hair either 
2014-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo|i don t feel that the organix line is an all natural line at all as it does contain chemicals to it also this shampoo does not agree with my hair at all there is nothing nourishing about it at all instead it left my hair very dry and rough feeling after i used it i do not plan to ever use it again 
2020-10|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i straighten my hair quite often this oily helps me leave my hair shiny after i mercilessly hurting it with the heat i probably should fix my hair routine first but anyway this is a great stuff it doesn t make my hair greasy excellent product a tiny bit goes a long way 
2019-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|weighs down hair and makes it very difficult to style the next day wether it be with a curling iron or straighter this oil is also not pure and has silicones in it silicones can be good but if you use them too much it will cause a lot of buildup on the hair and make it drier in the long run if you re applying a oil it s better to use a pure one i prefer the live clean argan oil 
2018-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i also use the same brand s conditioner i use conditioner everyday but only use this oil when i m sure i ll let my hair down this oil gives amazing glossy shine to my hair i usually apply to still dump hair mainly from the middle part to the tip of the hair never from the loot as my scalp skin is quite oily so it will be too much a little goes a long way with this product 
2017-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|pro nice smell con heavy does not tame my hair oily and silicony made me lose hair big no no if you look into the ingredients the argan oil comes in the last ones meaning there is very little product other than just kernel oil 
2017-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|mmm super bummed with this my hair is over processed dry crunchy ends i ve stopped coloring and blow drying to try and give it a break so i bought this to help go au naturale it literally does nothing on wet hair damp hair dry hair nothing a lot or a little nada effect i ve tried to see if blowing out will act as a catalyst but nay still dry looking i have much better luck with the paul mitchell skinny serum dupe at sally s or garnier s morrocan oil both of those transform my hair fantastically 
2017-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|this is an oil on the heavier side feels like oil amp silicone combined smells great but have to be careful of the amount u use or else it sits in your hair ends makes ur hair appear wet i prefer lighter hair oils that absorb well into hair this also does not really visibly tame my hair or soften shine it wouldnt repurchase
2017-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|this product left my hair greasy looking regardless of the amount i used i was surprised because i have thick dark blonde virgin hair the oil sits on the hair cuticle and does not seem to penetrate i use avon moroccan 360 oil now that s worth investing in and it s not expensive 
2017-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|this is almost as good as more expensive oils but a fraction of the price makes my hair softer smoother and easier to blow dry and style it s not heavy or greasy at all it doesn t weigh hair down hair looks naturally silkier like i just left the salon i do find my hair doesn t hold a curl as well when i use argan oil products though but overall good to use for a blow out 
2017-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|this is the firts argan oil i ever used in my hair i have many treatments keratin and i really hate my hair i have to go to a beauty salon every time i wash my hair it looks healthy but it isn t my real hair i born with a very very soft wavy hair and then in a bs they cut my hair and since then it s been a nightmare soooooo i really love this product if you want your hair to look healthy buy it 
2016-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|it s a nice oil but i don t know why whenever i apply argan oil i have massive hair loss i m not saying argan oil is bad for your hair i m happy with my hair the way it is 
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i finished this up and didn t repurchase but as my hairs fly away and frizzy i remembered how manageable and silky it used make my hair very good product for the price highly recommend best thing is it doesn t weigh hair down even though my hair is extremely fine 
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|this product has miraculously left my hair so healthy looking not the ultra gloss which requires high amount of styling just a drop that i spread onto my short to medium length damp hair and my ends don t look dry anymore they look smooth and fresh it dint steal the bounce either smells great and i like the uv protection the best part is the simplicity in usage that leaves great tresses d
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|wow some background i have long coarse hair it gets wavy and frizzy after it s wet so in my eternal battle to tame it i m glad i found a product like this i bleached my hair 4 times in the past two months in my latest hair color quest to go from black to manic panic red looks great but the bleaching washing and dying really killed my hair until i found this product found it at walmart didn t cost too much about 6 years ago i had excellent results with the organix coconut serum so i was excited to give this a try i m glad i did i use a little on my hair after i get out of the shower let my hair air dry then redo my ends again before i hit it with a flat iron after that while my hair is still warm i redo the ends with a tiny bit more my hair is super thick and the ends get dry naturally so this product really soaks in if you have thinner hair use only a little bit as far as packaging i don t really have an issue with the lid wish it was a pump though the scent is pleasing and not too obvious after flat ironing my hair is silky smooth normal like it should be instead of crispy and dry and poofy because of bleach and dye this product rescued my hair this weekend i want to do a repair masque with this product and some deep conditioner look forward to ironing my hair now for once 5 stars 
2015-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i guess it made my hair soft but once applied to my hair any part of skin my hair came into contact with broke out horribly i have weird small pimples along my jaw my cheek where my hair brushed against a few times and other places my hair just lightly touched i had clear skin before this wouldn t buy again very disappointed 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i tried this recently and really liked it i like to use oils to detangle dry hair and this gives me the slip i need the consistency is light and the smell is nice 
2015-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i m so surprised by the high rating the smell is unbearable and overpowering i can put up with greasy serums if using a little bit will really help my hair be smoother shinier this serum does not deliver anything but smelly greasiness the garnier fructis sleek and shine moroccan sleek oil treatment is hg for me i also like the chi and gvp paul mitchell serum 
2015-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i use this as a heat protectant before i straighten my hair and it makes my hair sooo soft there are no fly aways i also use this on damp hair and when it s dry i love this 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i m currently 27 yo with waist length black hair my hair is fine with curly ends i shampoo condition and use hairdryer everyday at noon i first saw this product at watsons when i visited singapore i never see it before at jakarta my hometown and i thought i d like to give it a try my hair can get very oily at the end of the day on the scalp but very dry and splitting at the other end i use a drop of this moroccan oil every afternoon and i noticed my hair is slowly getting better i found less split ends nowadays defly will buy again 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i love this stuff it makes my hair shiny without it being oily it smells really nice as well just use a quarter size or less especially if you have finer hair 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i really love this product it is so light smells amazing and makes my hair so silky i wish the packaging was a little different because it s easy for a little to leak out but that s a small sacrifice to make when a product works so phenomenally my hair has never looked more gorgeous than when i use this 
2015-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i had been eying this particular moroccan oil for a while and finally got around to making the purchase at first i hated the product my expectation of the texture was oil like but instead it s serum like very silky i don t particularly like the fragrance which comes across as fabric softener or dish detergent the first application was on dry flat ironed hair which did absolutely nothing for me since then i use it as directed on damp towel dried hair and i like it it absorbs well and makes for lighter softer wash n goes how i wish there was more argan oil because as it is the formula is nothing special there are plenty of other equivalent serums with other oils that perform just as well but are cheaper i will rebuy but i won t go out of my way in search for it 
2015-08|2.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i used this expecting it to make my hair greasy to my surprise it actually made the ends of my hair frizzy and dry looking which they normally are not also this has way more silicone in it than oil 
2015-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|it made my hair feel slightly softer and shinier but if i accidentally apply too much it would make my hair very greasy and flat overall this product is nice but you just have to be careful of how much of the product you use
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|this stuff is amazing super amazing i have the argan oil of morocco extra penetrating oil for dry and course hair i cannot go with out this stuff my hair is pretty healthy i dont use heat on my hair expect for maybe once a month using a hair dryer and i dont use any hairspray or gel anything like that in my hair i have ling poker straight hair i do color it about once every 6 weeks to touch up my roots bc i have white blonde hair that i color black one of my biggest problems with my hair is knots esp after washing my hair its knot city so i seen this stuff last yr and decided to give it a try and ive been hooked ever since the smell is really nice i personally love it and they way it makes my hair feel is awesome its makes my hair soooo soft and shiny and it hust leaves it looking amazing if i dont use this stuff after the shower oh man my hair is dull knotty and just blahhh o even put this in my step daughters hair bc she gets crazy knots and it really helps her my hair has been doing so much better now that i ise this on a daily bases ive noticed alot less breakage less split ends and no frizz what so ever i also love this oil bc no matter how much i put in my hair i never get that greasy oily feeling i switched up like a month ago to this argon oil from sallys and i only put like a nickle size amount in my hair and it was soooo gross it was beyong oily and greasy just nasty so i went right back and couldnt be happier i usually use this after i get out of the shower and my hair is damp i start at my ends and work it up and whatever i have leftover on my hands ill put in my roots and it keeps my hair silky smooth unti my next washing 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|this is the reason why i m in love with argan oil i believe in it s amazing power i bought this 4 times already it s super great for dry fried hair does not weigh hair down still has volume even if i applied a lot i know that it s great because i tried other moroccan oils even more expensive ones they didn t give the same effect cheap and effective love it 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil| this is an amazing product am glad have been able to find it simply a magic bottle d love it d
2015-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|ok so i m in the minority with this product it was average for me my hair did feel softer and stronger but i wouldn t say i felt a huge difference my hair didn t feel silky or amazing in any way it also seemed to take foreverrrrrr to dry my hair maybe this is something that happens when using oil in general 
2015-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i adore this product it is like liquid gold for hair i have extremely dry hair at the moment it is moving into winter where i am and my hair is horrible this product along with using the organix deep conditioner has helped a lot and tames my hair a lot i will continue to buy it even after i get a keratin treatment to completely tame my frizz as it really does make my hair feel so much softer and manageable it also smells great nice and fresh i only gave it 4 lippies as it is very expensive in nz 
2015-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i bought this because i asked a friend of mine who always has such nice and shiny hair what she uses and this was it this stuff smells amazing and makes my hair super shiny and moisturized the only reason i don t love it is because this stuff gives me bacne if it touches my back and when i have it in my hair and then go to bed i get pimples on my cheeks and i never ever break out on my cheeks i still use it occasionally because i love what it does for my hair but i hate how i have to be so careful about not letting it touch my face or back i would probably rate this 5 stars if it didn t break me out 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|seriously this has changed my life i have wavy curly hair and a lot of it and frizz is a never ending battle i work some of this into my damp hair after a bit of scrunching with a towel twirl a few strands around for curl definition and let dry voila frizz free and hair my friends envy the fragrance is light and generally pleasant i was recently travelling and went without this product for a few days and i was really missing it my hair was considerably drier and held less curl it is a little heavy for use on dry hair and flyaways so i use something else for that i also go through bottles quite quickly because i have a lot of hair which does make it not cheap but most importantly it doesn t aggravate my horrifically sensitive skin 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i loooooove this oil i put it on every time i get out of the shower and even before bed on dry hair its great my hair absorbs it all it makes my hair soft and hydrates it my hair used to be so dead and dry from all the damage but now the ends have come back to life since i ve been using this my hair now has curls at the ends this stuff is amazing 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i bought this product after all the online reviews it is amazing smells incredible is easy to distribute through the hair and makes your hair so beautifully smooth especially after a shampoo amp conditioner it also lasts for ages as a little goes a long way the packaging can tend to get annoying as the excess oil can get stuck in the lid and around the opening though this is so minor i would not worry in the slightest it doesn t change my opinion on this product at all it is kind of expensive but it is definitely worth the price it makes your hair look and feel amazing i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants smoother hair without the pain of paying too much or going to any ridiculous lengths of time 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|so i picked up a sample of this on my way out in the check out line and i am so glad that i did that day this product is my staple everyday hair product i get out of the shower and apply a small amount to my damp hair starting at the ends and then i blowdry my hair or curl it or flatiron it it makes my hair look super moisturised and healthy went back and repurchased it again 
2014-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i really like this oil i enjoy most of the oils that organix has it smells absolutely fabulous very easy to distribute evenly throughout hair especially when used after a shower while hair is damp great for softening hair and helping to loosen any tight knots doesn t make my hair have that greasy feeling it leaves a nice shine only downside is the bottle i wish it were in a pump so that i could better control the amount of oil i want but no other complaints update been 3 months and i ve come to realize that this is what is giving me back acne and acne along my hair line 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i love this product and would definitely repurchase this after i take a shower i will run this product unto my hair before i towel dry it my hair is naturally frizzy and dry but after using it i dont need to flat iron my hair because it feels soft and looks smooth 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|omg i love the way this oil smells i can t even describe it it just smells luxurious and amazing haha i only apply to wet or damp hair because if i apply to dry hair it makes my hair look really oily it doesn t really absorb into the hair very well unless your hair s wet or damp i usually put it in after showering and towel drying my hair the smell lingers for a good amount of time especially if i leave my hair up in a bun while it s still wet i just can t say enough how great the smell is i definitely recommend it makes my hair soooo soft and silky love love love 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i run this through my thick hair and leave it in after i shampoo and condition organix renewing moroccan argan penetrating oil makes my hair silky soft and manageable no flyaways from the moment i remove my towel from my hair to blow dry and style the bottles i purchase are clear but it is the same product as the blue bottle pictured organix makes one for dry coarse hair and one for all hair types i have purchased both over several years and am currently using the one for all hair types this product is wonderful update i have found in addition to using this on my hair when it s wet a small dab of oil after my hair is dried and styled makes my style last longer and hair more voluminous 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|love love love this it makes my hair amazingly soft shiny and healthy have repurchased over and over and will continue to do so 
2014-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|nothing special except it is not greasy and make it easy to untangle and comb hair 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i use this stuff on damp hair and it s so nice and silky after i blow dry it doesn t feel weighed down at all the gold bottle and the packaging it comes in were very appealing to me shinyyy you don t have to use a lot of it and i have a feeling the bottle will last me awhile too 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i m always looking for products that make my thick fluffy hair more manageable without a lot of effort on my part i want smooth locks without using a blowdryer straightener gel etc this stuff is a lifesaver after a shower i comb about a dime sized amount of this oil through my damp hair and let it air dry i was amazed at how much better my hair looked with no additional product or tools only used a comb my hair laid in nice shiny waves with hardly any frizz or poof i paid about 8 for this which i found to be very reasonable especially considering the fact that argan oil from different lines can cost much more the packaging is a little different than pictured it has the same gold cap but the bottle is clear it seems sturdy enough that the cap won t easily pop open all in all i would definitely recommend this to those who struggle with frizz dryness or unwanted volume 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|after hearing all these rave reviews about argan oil i just had to get it but argan oil is ridiculously expensive in its purest form and since this is a lot cheaper i m guessing it isn t as organic as the pricier ones but irregardless it works wonders my hair is smoother silkier and it doesn t weigh it down i use it every few washes because i felt that for my hair applying it after every wash made it a little oily and heavy on my hair 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|yay i love this stuff a lot of oils have left my hair heavy and greasy but not this stuff it really nourishes the hair and keeps it looking healthy and glossy when i first used this product it felt like my hair belonged on a pantene commercial no joke i just follow the directions on the back the product and viola price is great in comparison to other argan oils and the packaging looks a little too bulky for me but whatever great product 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|omg i love this product so much i use it after every time i wash my hair i wash my hair at night on towel dried hair and comb it through i just apply it to my ends and midlengths i have the knottiest hair ever so this is great because it makes my hair so much easier to comb and it s such a breeze the next day my hair is soft shiny and smells great it doesn t weigh down my thin limp hair and doesn t make it greasy or oily the packaging on the one i have is the clear plastic squeezy bottle don t have much to say about it it looks fine and simple i honestly love this so much it is a bit expensive at around 24 aud but you only need a small amount every time you use it and it is a great investment and really replenishes those dry ends 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i love this my hair is thin and damage because i dyed it brown so it s always hell to comb it through as my hair is always tangled i can apply a lot of this serum on the ends of my hair and it gets absorbed into my hair making it so easy to comb through i do find that my hair will be somewhat tangled the next day even if i don t wash my hair but all in all it s worked like a dream i m running out of it i shall surely replenish it highly recommend this product 
2014-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i ve used a lot of different brands of argan oil in the last two years and this one is definitely my favorite when used with a light hand it really penetrates hair nicely and doesn t leave it oily it smells great i like to braid my hair right out of the shower and once it s dried about halfway i put a bit of the argan oil over the braids it does wonders and leaves my hair soft packaging is good a little goes a long ways i just wish there was a cleaner way of getting the product out rather than glopping it on your fingers however i ll definitely buy this again 
2014-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i have long fine straight easy to frizz asian hair and i wash my hair daily i don t like to put a lot of products in my hair since most of them don t really work or just weight my hair down this really solves the frizzy hair problem even my husband notices and knows about the quot magic blue bottle quot original package was blue that really works it tames the frizz adds shine strengthens and makes my hair healthier and it smells great best product great price i like everything about it i use it everyday and can t live without please never discontinue this 
2013-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i came across this range when i was looking for some argan oil for my hair the price is so good when compared to other brands ive seen i bought the oil for â 6 99 but boots had an offer on for two for â 8 so i bought the shampoo too my hair is very long and ombre so dark brunette t the top and goes to light blonde at the bottom the shampoo worked so well and didnt feel heavy or geeasy i use a pea sized splodge of the oil and work it from roots to my tips on towel dried hair the oil supprisingly isnt greasy at all it makes my hair soooo shiney and soft and the condition of my hair has drastically improved i use this everytime i wash my hair would recommended this to anyone with any hair type xx
2013-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|absolutely love this oil would definitely repurchase wouldn t say it was cheap but is reasonably priced i bought mine for 6 99gbp but you do get 100ml and you only need a pea sized amount each time you use it it came in an attractive gold and blue box and a nicely shaped bottle if nicely shaped bottles is something you re into haha i have definitely noticed a difference since using this product though i use it each time after i have washed my hair when it is slightly damp i just rub it through the mid lengths to the ends not only does it detangle my hair it leaves it so smooth and shiny my ends were getting quite dry from heat styling etc and honestly since using this my ends feel much more nourished it also has a lovely fresh scent my sister uses the shampoo and conditioner from the same range and she says she loves it so maybe i should try out more from the range would recommend to anybody to try it out 
2013-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i really liked this the smell was great and it moisterized the ends and it didnt leave my hair greasy or oily the packaging is rather small and kinda expensive but its worth it 
2013-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|back when this first came out they only had one version and i found it to be really heavy waxy and coating but now they have more versions and i bought the quot light quot version for fine brittle hair i adore it it s not heavy at all it adds shine makes my hair soft and doesn t build up love 
2013-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i loved this stuff somehow it lasted me 2 years it smells so good amp i love the packaging it s more of a serum than an oil and i liked to use it on wet hair mostly on the ends and whatever s left on the roots to smooth the frizz a tiny bit only this smooths my hair reduces frizz amp makes it soft and shiny like any hair oil you have to be careful not to use too much or your hair could feel sticky amp weighed down sometimes i would use it on dry hair if i had any frizz and it worked fine i would repurchase 
2013-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i bought this after trying the accompanying shampoo and conditioner i use a dime ish sized amount every night before bed and wake up with soft and smooth hair before i bought this i had a hard time finding a product to put in my hair at night that would keep my sheets from sucking all of the moisture out of my hair and still not be greasy enough to give me pimples i know this problem could ve also been solved by a satin bonnet but i get night sweats i don t like the smell of it on my hands so i do wash my hands after using the oil it doesn t seem to have much of a scent on my hair and my pillows don t smell any different 
2013-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|omg the smell of this is so amazing i love it 
2013-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|having heard all the raves about argan oil i was looking around for a product to try that wouldn t break the bank i looked at similar products at a beauty supply store salon but all of those were priced way over the top 14 for the cheapest one and 30 for others uhm no this one available in most drug stores wasn t the cheapest one on the shelves but the golden hue was enticing and the price was just right at about 8 the last time i repurchased i took advantage of a sale at cvs and it ended up being about 6 a bottle lasts me 4 5 months or so before i blow dry i put a nickle to quarter size amount of this moroccan argan penetrating oil on my palms and rub them together to evenly coat my hands i have long hair so if you have shorter hair you definitely won t need that much then i run my hands through the longest 1 2 of my hair with my head upside down then i flip my hair back up and use the remaining product on the palms of my hands to gloss over the top and back then i blow dry as usual this really seems to help with fly aways and frizz as long as i m careful to evenly distribute it throughout my hair i m not really sure how quot penetrating quot it is but it works really well on the surface of my hair to make it softer calmer and shinier without weighing it down the scent is subtle and pleasant but i don t really notice that the scent lingers after my hair dries i ve also used tiny amounts of it on dry hair as a quot spot quot treatment for frizzy fly aways and it works well that way too be aware as others have mentioned using it on wet hair that isn t blown dry doesn t yield the same results at all in fact i d avoid using it on your hair if you re just going to let it air dry maybe it is the heat from the dryer that allows this product to evenly coat your hair and work magic who knows it does work though 
2013-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|this product is amazing and cruelty free i have long wavy hair about half way down my back and i m trying to grow it longer when i brush out my hair it can get quite frizzy but as soon as i use this product it smooths the frizz and makes it feel soft and moisturized using this on the ends of my hair from the neck down has helped me minimize the amount of conditioning products that i have to use on my hair this feels like a very natural product to use and the bottle of it lasts a long time i ve been using it multiple times a day for months and i still have a generous amount of product left the smell is wonderful as well whenever i put this on my hair people will sniff the air and ask where the good smell is coming from i highly recommend this to anyone especially if you have long hair that you want to keep healthy and soft 
2013-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|oil is ok i don t like the fact that you can tell there is product on your hair i found that it did a lot better if i used it before blow drying however if i used it and let my hair air dry i didn t really like the way it sat on my hair didn t seem to soak in made my hair hard like i had put gel on it 
2013-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i used the shampoo and conditioner from this same line altogether as a system and altogether none of them did anything but leave my already dry frizzy hair even drier and more limp no amount of this penetrating oil seemed to moisturize my hair at all and i ve used anywhere from a quarter sized amount to literally half of the travel size bottle for each time i applied it to my towel dried hair to no avail my hair recovered its softness volume and shine after using dove s nourishing oil care system for about half the price 
2013-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|absolutely love this product truth be told i ve loved every organix product i ve purchased their tea tree and mint shampoo is amazing i was hesitant at first because for the price 8 at my local grocery store i thought the bottle seemed quite small however i ve had this bottle for almost 6 months and i m nowhere near running out all it takes is a dime sized squirt and it s more than enough to cover my long hair this has made my dry hair so much softer and shinier it s even helped my desperately split ends i know i should just cut them off but i hate losing length plus it smells so good i generally go two days between shampoos and this product helps keep my hair smelling and looking good before i wash it i usually put it on right after i get out of the shower and sometimes i put it on in the shower right after rinsing my conditioner out it s a great detangler as well 
2013-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil|i like this product because it makes my hair shinier and feel smoother i find that i have to use a clarifying shampoo after using it though because it does feel like it weighs my hair down just a bit but i like it it s cheap and works well enough for me to repurchase 
2020-10|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|this shampoo made my scalp so itchy i also noticed my hair was becoming greasier more quickly after a few uses i switched to another shampoo and my scalp wasn t itchy anymore i had to throw it away 
2019-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|great shampoo for post workout gives the scalp a cold cleanse really nice smell and lathers well 
2018-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i am on the fence with this shampoo on the first day i use it my hair feels refreshed but once second day hair hits my hair flattens out more than it would before my hair typically doesn t get greasy until 3rd 4th day hair i find that it is hydrating but my hair feels more weighed down since i started using this my scalp has also felt more itchy strange because i think it s quot supposed to quot help with that issue i would recommend their moroccan oil shampoo over this one because it does a way better job cleaning my hair than this does 
2017-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i quot m not quite sure why this shampoo has so many negative review s i honestly love it about my hair color treated split ends damaged dry ends oily scalp naturally wavy use heat tools often although i have been taking a 2 week break i love the smell its fresh minty the packaging is adorable bright green the consistency of the shampoo is a bit thick however dont let that scare you it wasnt at all too heavy on my oily scalp it cleaned my hair i didnt need too use a large amount tea tree has a lot of benefits for your hair helps with oil amp dandruff also dry patches on your scalp which i struggle with all three also helps with demodex mites which i struggled in the past with my skin more then my hair i used this shampoo an the paul mitchell tea tree honestly this one is far more better i have included my reasons its also safe for color treated hair unlike most tea tree shampoos that fade your hair color this one doesn t because its sulfate free overall i think its a great shampoo pricing is amazing too because its not more then 8 00 an it comes in two sizes first size is 13 fl oz i have found it at walmart for 5 00 the second size is 19 5 fl oz which i also purchased at walmart an it was on sale for 6 75 so thats a bargin it lasts forever its moisturizing and helps with oily scalp so it can work as a balancing shampoo as well i find that my scalp is less oily when i use it an i can go longer in between showers an i find that my ends arent as dry my hair is shiny an not very frizzy yes i reccomend this shampoo over and over what a great affordable gem 
2017-08|2.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|well first off this is my first bottle of this style scent tea tree oil and mint it smells so great like chocolate and mint candy that s where the product goodness goes awry i didn t buy the conditioner it was to expensive when i wasn t sure i d like this one it made my longish thick course and wavy hair a tangled feeling mess it felt striped of all oils i had to put argon dry oil on it to even able to attempt to comb the tangles out another thing i want to add here the tea tree oil and peppermint oil are both known to kill demodex mites they live are hatched and die inside hair follicles and pores that is why some people in these reviews felt an itchiness in their scalps that hadn t been there before use they had quot aggravated quot the mites of which all humans have but few ever notice until something aggravates them then they re hell on earth for the person affected look them up online many articles to learn more about them most have photographs of the mites when this shampoo came into contact with pores that were nests to the mites it started to kill them some would ve been longer to be affected and others could ve fled down the neck or into the ears just wanted toads my thoughts on this shampoo and knowledge of the demodex mites 
2017-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|this is the worst shampoo i ve used in my entire life i d give it negative five stars if i could i normally have healthy shiny beautiful hair but this shampoo made it disgustingly greasy and waxy especially at the roots my hair was falling out by the fistful and had become impossible to style it felt like i had put effing glue in my hair thankfully apple cider vinegar fixed everything but i will never spend my money on organix anything again seriously horrible product don t buy it 
2017-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|my absolute favorite shampoo i enjoy most of what i ve tried from ogx or organix but the tea tree line is just the best for my hair i have very fine wavy hair that tends to be on the drier side this is moisturizing without weighting my hair down leaves my hair very clean feeling and smells absolutely amazing i m sure it not for every hair type no shampoo really is but for me it works wonders i ve been using it for several years now and i definitely notice when i stray and try something new 
2017-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|the packaging of all the ogx products is cute if not super travel friendly i had high hopes that this would be good for my scalp unfortunately it left my hair feeling greasy even after trying it a few different times my hair looks like it wasn t washed at all i will definitely not repurchase 
2016-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i love this product speeds up the growth of my hair while improving the condition of my scalp it gently cleans my hair and doesn t leave behind any oily residue 
2015-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|organix sucks i ve tried it a few times when it first came out and when it was on sale nope it sucks it leaves my hair totally unmanageable it does have a minty smell but leaves no smell at all in my long thick wavy hair i do like my hair to smell nice and i do have to say that is one of the factors for me when i add a new shampoo or conditioner into my hair care rotation basically this shampoo is all hype all jelly no toast blah blah blah it didn t do anything spectacular for my hair except make it a tangled mess for me to detangle and that really pissed me off it was like i didn t use any conditioner and i have a few different shampoos from other countries that i love and have no conditioner and they still work great not organix anyway boo to this stuff maybe my hair needs the sulfates or what ever they are leaving out either way i m done trying and buying organix it doesn t work for me i m ok with sulfates and parabens not a problem for my hair because it is tough i guess 
2015-08|2.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|let s talk about the big elephant in the room for one this brand is anything but organic the play on the word quot organics quot is very misleading and apparently the less than stellar reviews seem to accurately reflect the quality of the quot pure and simple quot products by quot organi x quot well now it s been changed to ogx i have low porosity 3c 4a hair and my biggest issue is chronic dryness in fairness i purchased just the shampoo and it was average usually the results are better in conjunction to using with the conditioner but it s not so much that the product quot dried out quot my hair or quot damaged quot it it just did nothing for me the smell is disturbingly artificial similar to synthetic soap with a subtle hint of mint maybe tea tree i don t know and you would think that an ingredients such as peppermint and tea tree are sustainable and relatively cheap essential oils i m baffled as to why i can t even detect it in the shampoo overall this shampoo is an over hyped generic shampoo that doesn t deliver on their promises the only positive feedback i can give for this sub par product is that their bottle designs are cute and it didn t quot damage or dry quot my hair 
2015-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i have very thick long hair i sort of like this shampoo and sort of don t as another person said it is bogus and crappy the fact that they play up on the word organic when this product is definitely not and it is more pricey that what it should be i find that irritating i do loveee the smell even if it is fake and not of essential oils partially why i went back to this shampoo the smell alone i like smells fresh and unique it does feel a little minty on my scalp when washing and that feels nice my hair is beautiful soft and shiny hydrated after using but the most annoying thing i find is that my scalp is itchy after soo i probably won t buy again it s funny that my scalp would be itchy and have some bumps after a shampoo that has tea tree and mint since tea tree usually helps with that type of thing so it must be the other chemicals and ingredients in this that my skin finds irritating sucks because i do like the feel of my hair after and love the smell i have used the morrocan argan oil shampoo from this brand and i like it but my hair isn t as soft as it is with the tea tree mint their kukui oil shampoo conditioner i didn t like at all left my hair dry and gross 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|the packaging is a bit bulky but very sturdy everyone is saying that this product dries out their hair but honestly it s so moisturizing and leaves my long fine hair feeling like silk it s sulfate free and cleans amazingly without leaving my scalp dry and tight the consistency is a gel like green formula which is great for my oily roots and dry ends if you are super prone to dryness i would skip this amp go for a formula that is more rich and creamy but for me it moisturizes my hair beautifully even thought it s not the cheapest for the amount you get this is the only shampoo from the drugstore that is truly gentle and sulfate free which is huge for me since sulfate filled shampoos leave my scalp so tight dry itchy and frizzy i absolutely adore the mint chocolate chip scent but i can understand why other people would dislike it 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i absolutely love organix and their products i use several of their products and this is my staple item it always leaves my hair really clean and fresh i have very thick coarse frizzy hair and am frequently applying oils and using shampoos and conditioners to help make my hair shiny sometimes if i use too many products or silky shampoos my hair will produce too much natural oil and even after a fresh wash might start to appear oily when that happens all i need is one good wash with my tea tree mint shampoo and conditioner it cleanses my hair to a more natural form without stripping it while washing the mint invigorates my scalp and makes me feel awake while the tea tree oil leaves my hair moisturized but not oily it lathers very nicely smells very nice and makes my hair feel really clean it replenishes my hair to a nice clean state but still takes away unwanted frizz after the shower my hair is naturally soft and healthy this is the first organix product i tried and it is still one of my favorites the price is incredible and the results are worth triple the price at least i would recommend this to anyone looking for a shampoo conditioner that will clean your hair well while also making it soft and healthy for a great price 
2014-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i think everything about this brand is bogus organix does not even use organic ingredients it just plays on the name to confuse people and convince them to pay more for inferior products and non organic ingredients this shampoo does not work as well as other cheaper shampoos and actually left my roots greasy and my ends frizzy i would not repurchase this product 
2014-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i have tried a lot of the organix shampoo and conditioners and i find that either they are pretty good or not that great at all this one has a really good smell that i love but what makes me ultimately not like it is the fact that it doesn t make my hair soft or untangled enough to even brush out after my shower i feel like most moisturizing shampoos conditioners leave your hair soft and this one left it feeling pretty rough and not manageable it is more of a clarifying shampoo so i guess that s why it doesn t really make it too soft it lathers well but that doesn t matter to me the smell is enough to make me finish the bottle but after its gone i will not be repurchasing just cause i prefer something that will make my hair soft and healthy feeling instead of rough and overly clean 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|this is a great shampoo because it gives a deep clean while actually moisturizing your hair at the same time i bleach my hair so as a result i have pretty dry ends but my roots get super oily clarifying shampoos get all the grease out of my roots but tend to leave my ends tangled and dry moisturizing shampoos keep my ends looking healthy but make my roots look like i haven t washed my hair in weeks this has been a lifesaver because it gives me a thorough clean but it makes my hair feel soft shiny and manageable added bonus i ve been dealing with a dry scalp latley and using this regularly seems to really have helped this stuff smells amazing i don t notice any tea tree scent just a super minty smell if you re not a mint lover though i haven t noticed the scent of this lingering in my hair so no worries the consistency of this is kind of weird it comes out in almost gel like blobs it s not runny or slippery at all like most shampoos are because of the consistency i find that i have to use quite a bit of this to get it to lather in my hair but if i use enough this gives a nice lather and it rinses clean no residue or coated feeling in the hair afterwards i ll definitely be picking this up again and i ll be trying more from this line i believe the line is called ogx now i recommend this to anyone who likes minty scents in the shower and anyone who needs a lilttle extra moisture in their their hair or scalp 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|oh how i love the scent of this it makes me so happy i wish the bottles were larger or the price less because it really does not do anything for my hair other than smell good i would still buy this maybe just once a year when i want to take a long hot shower and have a little treat and unwind but because there is no benefit to my hair the bottles are so small and my hair very very long i have no other use for this but to make my senses happy and it does lol 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i have long curly hair and this product works wonders removes build up and leaves my hair feeling fresh i love the scent as well 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i have a bob right now that is a few inches above my shoulders my hair is super straight and tends to be on the oily side i only have to condition maybe twice a week i usually go for volumizing shampoos nothing with heavy moisture i love this shampoo it smells so wonderful and makes my hair soft and manageable way better than my normal dove shampoo this is a good balance for me between cleansing and moisturizing i ve been using it for 2 months now and my boyfriend seriously loves it as well the tea tree oils and mint just feel so good on your scalp 
2014-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|this shampoo wouldn t clean my hair i have really long thick hair and no matter how many times i washed it or how much i used my hair always looked greasy and felt dirty 
2014-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i have used this product and its matching conditioner for about half a year i have tried the other ones as well the tea tree mint shampoo for me is best served as a clarifying shampoo i personally love the scent reminds me of mint chocolate chip and am not bothered by it then again i also love mint chocolate chip ice cream so that may have something to do with it it does leave my hair dry after use but it also removes build up fairly well i think there are better shampoos out there for the same price with equally pleasant scents that do a better job but until i find one i will continue to use this one i use this one once a week as i use a lot of pomades and wax products i have short hair so that may be why this shampoo is tolerable for me judging by the other reviews if you have curly hair or medium to long hair this is likely not the shampoo for you 3 5 not amazing but not bad either 
2014-08|2.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i purchased this product because i love the smell of mint but i found this shampoo s scent overwhelmingly heady and sweet prior to purchasing this product i had used paul mitchell tea tree lavender mint shampoo therefore i was anticipating a similar cooling mint y scent that tingles the scalp the packaging is bulky which i do not prefer either yet was willing to give it a try for the listed ingredients it is not a bad product as it does its job my hair is clean and smells acceptable if you prefer a sweeter smelling shampoo with a subdued mint y scent organix tea tree mint shampoo is for you 
2014-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|this shampoo does a terrific job of cleansing the hair without stripping it one word of caution is the fragrance this smells strongly of mint almost like mint chocolate chip ice cream and the scent lingers although i like the smell i know tastes can runs differently as far as fragrance goes so if you don t like the smell of mint you won t like this shampoo 
2013-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i picked this up at walmart for about 5 after looking for something with tea tree oil in it for my itchy scalp and dandruff i can t use head and shoulders because it leaves the crown of my head greasy from product buildup i love the smell and the tingly feeling it gives me when i use it it s perfect to wake up to in the morning when i m half asleep it doesn t stop the flaking but i do really enjoy the smell and feeling of this shampoo 
2013-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i love organix products i alternate between this one and the repairing awapuhi ginger shampoo amp conditioner i like both about the same so it really just depends on which lovely scent i m in the mood for my hair is very thick wavy and slightly coarse and i find that this shampoo cleans it very well without stripping it of its moisture out of all the organix variations i ve tried i find that this one lathers the best which is a definite plus my scalp is sensitive and prone to dryness and flaking and i find that the tea tree and mint are particularly kind and soothing it smells lovely and rinses out clean the matching conditioner is great too 
2013-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i enjoy the brand organix for the most part i have super straight hair that s oily but prone to getting frizzy it cleaned my hair and smelled amazing but my hair didn t feel super soft or get very shiny if you want a clean that doesn t strip i d advise it if you want super soft and shiny hair not so much 
2013-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i love this shampoo i would use it more but i tone my hair now and i use a color saver shampoo so yah other than that i love it the packaging the smell my fave smell in the world mint the color of the shampoo and the fact that it does what it says and it s organic which is always good 
2013-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i ve been using this product for about 5 6 months now amp i particularly use it for its tea tree agents amp being sulfate free i use another shampoo as well but i workout a lot amp use this one to clean my scalp well but not strip my hair dry the smell is pleasant enough but could be better a good smelling conditioner afterwards could gets rid of the minty smell although i like it got it for a little less than 6 at walmart amp plan on keeping this as a part of my regimen 
2013-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i looove this shampoo it is probably the best product that i ve ever used on my curly hair the shampoo itself is very drying but has never left my hair in tangles and when paired with the matching conditioner leaves my hair completely silky and frizz free it is a bit pricey for a drugstore shampoo but definitely worth it for how well it works my only warning is that all of the organix bottles generally look the same so you need to be careful that you check the labels for shampoo and conditioner on them i ve made that mistake twice and ended up with several extra conditioner bottles 
2013-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo| i really like the organix line and when i saw this at a pharmacy the bottle was twice the size of a normal bottle at half the price so i bought both the shampoo and conditioner this shampoo doesn t leave my hair as silky and manageable as the organix shea butter and argan oil which is my regular it was still an okay result though i wouldn t buy it again only because i don t need teatree oil right now which stimulates growth i d rather have my hair restored and protected by the shea and argan
2013-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|when i read all the bad reviews i decided i wasn t going to buy this shampoo however my nana once had the moroccan argan one and it was good so when she bought the tea tree mint shampoo amp conditioner i decided to try it without the conditioner it might dry your hair out when i followed up with the conditioner i used it on the bottom half and waited 5 minutes before washing it out but when i felt my hair the top was a little dry compared to the rest so i put a little on the top and waited about 10 15 seconds before washing it out and it felt the same i do have color treated hair but i had no problems with it affecting my bleach blonde in fact my hair feels soft looks beautiful and smells great let me tell you when lathering and it does lather well the smell is very strong but after washing it out it s noticeable but much more subtle i m not sure if i ll purchase this particular one as the peppermint y smell while good isn t my favorite next time i m at the store i smell test to see if others are better either way i definitely will be keep checking out organix products 
2013-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i have naturally curly hair and dealing with dry scalp i mean this product is alright it does not remove build up on your scalp thats for sure but it was good while it lasted i tried to hurry up and get rid of it 
2013-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i have medium density hair that s only color treated on the bottom 3 4 inches it s super healthy accept for the ends the ends get quite frizzy when it s left to air dry which i do frequently being the mother of an infant i also have a pretty flaky scalp i ve never had that much of a problem with it until i delivered my daughter i suppose the hormone drop really changed things anyway i purchased this product because my husband who always has dandruff said his hair stylist used a tea tree shampoo on him and it instantly cleared his flakes this is not the case for me it seems that it does help with them maybe a tad bit but not enough that i would repurchase it it smells pretty good but the smell doesn t last when your hair dries i do find this shampoo is pretty moisturizing upon first use it seemed like it really dried my hair but i honestly think it was trying to balance the ph in my hair since then i ve used it with every shampoo and have noticed that once it s rinsed out my hair feels soft when wet almost like i wouldn t need to use a conditioner overall i wouldn t repurchase this just because it didn t help with my flakies other than that i have no complaints it never claims to rid you of flakes just to add some moisture which i believe it does 
2012-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i saw good reviews on other sites which is why i bought this product i m surprised so many people on this site don t like it i have oily hair i wash it every other day but by day 2 it s pretty oily at the roots so i wear it up i just purchased this earlier this week and i like it already it s not like other shampoos out on the market and if you go into it knowing that then you won t hate it it s sulfate free so it doesn t quot soap up quot when you wash but this is better for your hair anyway it seems to take all the oil out of my hair but doesn t strip it the conditioners seems really moisturizing but i m not sure that it is i ve had better and i also use leave in conditioner they have a lot of different types of shampoo maybe i ll try a different one next time around i notice my hair is a bit bouncier and softer and it smells nice it s not oil free all of sudden but it seems to be slightly less oily it s only been a few days so it s not screaming quot best shampoo ever quot at me but i ve definitely used worse time will tell i do recommend it for oil prone hair types give it a shot 
2012-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i tried this shampoo a couple of months ago because i heard that tea tree oil and peppermint oil helps if you have oily hair scalp when i tried it though i was very disappointed it didn t decrease the oil in my hair and even worst it didn t clean well at all after air drying i could see what appeared to be white dust in my hair if you re looking for something in the organix line i would recommend the acai berry avocado shampoo it s great 
2012-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|huh i use an assortment of shampoos and conditioners and my hair is usually shiny but i noticed that my scalp which is oily and greasy was is getting really really dry after reading the reviews here my guess that is it probably from this shampoo that s really too bad because i love the smell and i now have a huge bottle of it 
2012-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i bought this product because i was having hair troubles my hair was greasy right after i washed it and i read somewhere that tea tree oil is great for helping the scalp with those kind of problems so while i wasn t expecting much i certainly did not expect my hair to turn out so gross it was even dirtier than before honestly my hair felt wet as if i drowned my hair in shampoo even though i put just a dime i was really disapointed and disgusted i will give it credit for it s smell because it was enjoyable i returned this product the next day you should give it a try if you like organix and tea tree oil but this shampoo simply didn t work for my hair 
2012-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|because my hair is dry and chemically processed this shampoo was not a good match it works more like a clarifying shampoo and left my hair dry and brittle judging by the reviews it seems this shampoo might work better for oily hair the good news is that my 6 year old loves the scent and uses it as body wash 
2012-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i moved on from this to the coconut milk shampoo in the organix line as i think this is either discontinued now in australia or they ve stopped stocking it as it wasn t that popular i did use this for a fair while though and retailing at only 6 it was a huge steal first off it smells exactly like mint chocolate but unfortunately the scent doesn t linger and immediately disappears when you come out of the shower i have very oily hair and i have to wash my hair daily or use a crap load of dry shampoo this definitely dries out the hair somewhat so if you were looking for something hydrating i would recommend the cherry blossom version which made my hair oily within the same day as washing it since the tea tree mint shampoo was drying it actually did wonders for my oily hair tea tree oil is supposed to be really good for oily hair which is what made me buy it in the first place i love the organix line as they re sulfate free but definitely advise using a clarifying shampoo to remove build up thats what sulfate is good for recommend this to anyone who can get their hands on it and is suffering from oily hair
2012-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|this is definitely my favorite shampoo that i have ever gotten i love the smell of it so much when you put it in your hair it feels so refreshing it also makes my naturally wavy hair more wavy my hair has definitely improved because of ow hydrating it is and it also really cleans my hair it s rare for me to find a shampoo that makes my hair soft and cleans i m so happy i found this shampoo and my brother uses it too 
2012-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|first off my hair was suer dry i am in the process of going natural and i wanted something would hydrate my hair i am a fan of buying expensive hair products in belief that they will work better this was not always the case i had heard some good things about organix and it was super cheap so i decided to purchase i used the product with garnier triple nutrition conditioner and the sleek and shine serum it worked fabulous together my hair did not feel dry after washingbit and with the triple nutrition conditioner my hair was hydrated shiny and smooth my hair stayed this way for about a week which is good enough for me i have used the product two more times sonce then and i have no complaints i will probably try another organix shampoo and compare the two but overall this a good product 
2012-08|2.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i bought this shampoo looking for a tingling shampoo it doesn t tingle it doesn t make my soft or shiny it actually dried my hair out since i have oily hair that isn t necessarily a bad thing but it wasn t what i was expecting since the product says quot moisturizing quot in the title it smells good but the scent doesn t last long at all after i get out of the shower the smell is all but gone 
2012-08|2.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|used this on my fine straight medium thickness hair it turned out to be entirely too drying for my hair i used it with the matching conditioner and my hair was always dry and knotted after washing which was never the case before i love other lines by organix but i am not a fan of the tea tree mint line at all 
2012-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i have long relaxed hair amp this is perfect for use as a clarifying shampoo it doesn t strip your hair i love the chocolate mint smell amp it tingles slightly peppermint amp tea tree are great for your scalp i use a lot of products so other sulfate free shampoos would leave a buildup on my hair amp scalp amp make it tangled this is perfect amp i m glad that i ve found a shampoo that cleans while leaving natural oils in my hair amp scalp my relaxed hair needs all the moisture it can get i always follow every wash with a deep conditioning treatment my hair always feels so moisturized 
2012-08|2.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|this smells fabulous and i might recommend it for very oily hair but it seems to strip all of the needed moisture and shine out of my hair 
2012-08|2.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|smelled really nice and the lather was decent it however dried out my hair and made it unmanageable for a better organic shampoo i would recommend giovanni s product line or david babaii for wildaid 
2012-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|my hair loved this shampoo when it was super short now that it s grown past my shoulders this shampoo just doesn t work the same i kind of don t like the cone in it either i don t avoid silicones as far as conditioners stylers go but i don t like them in my shampoos it s a little drying but not as drying as most shampoos i ve tried plus the accompanying conditioner that i used to also enjoy when my hair was shorter took care of that i might revisit it and edit my review in the near future because this was one of the first products i went to after cutting off all my permed hair and i loved it 
2012-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i use this with the tea tree mint conditioner and get decent results it makes my hair especially shiny and silky when i blow dry and straighten on days that i don t use teat styling products though i think the shampoo makes my hair a bit dry it works better when used before using heat styling products also it doesn t do much for dandruff i bought the tea tree in the hopes that it would reduce dandruff as tea tree is known for helping to maintain healthy scalp i like the organix products but i think after i use up the bottle i will try another shampoo conditioner overall i would recommend if you blow dry and straighten frequently 
2011-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i usually use the cherry blossom shampoo from organix but i decided to try this one because it smells like andes mints i liked it i didn t love it it had my head feeling a little dry and itchy even with a conditioner my hair did feel clean though 
2011-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|my hg shampoo the smell is ah mazing and it leaves my hair feeling incredibly clean soft and fresh i don t understand the negative reviews that some other users have given it except to say that they have different hair types needs and expectations from a shampoo but for me it works fabulously i have used it for 2 years and have never felt the need to try anything else since i used to use pantene before that and it left me underwhelmed with the so so results i have long fairly thick naturally wavy frizzy dark blonde hair and this makes it incredibly soft shiny and easy to manage i would recommend you try it and see if it works for you 
2011-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|this shampoo smells fantastic but unfortunately it doesn t seem to work very well not terrible just not great i have fine hair that was recently highlighted but i have an oily scalp even before the highlighting this shampoo seemed to do an inadequate job of cleansing and to give my hair a kind of waxy coating with my budget i m trying to quot use up quot the shampoos i have before buying new and i guess i felt like i quot should quot use this one up because of the price and the fact that it s sulfate free my tween daughter loves the cherry blossom ginseng shampoo from this company so i may buy that but i won t be buying the tea tree mint again p s the tea tree mint conditioner is also unimpressive 
2011-08|5.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i really enjoy this shampoo even though my hair gets fairly greasy i usually have a dry itchy scalp that tends to flake especially during winter after using this a few weeks my scalp just healed up and my hair looks better than ever i follow up with a deep conditioner this is not moisturizing enough for the bottom part of my hair and my hair has never looked better my hairdresser complimented me on how good my hair and scalp look i ve gone through two bottles and will try the other shampoos organix has to offer if i m unhappy with them i ll just come back to this one great shampoo in my book 
2011-08|3.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i don t love this but i don t hate this shampoo either i was expecting this to smell more like tea tree oil but instead this smells like mint chocolate to me it lathers up fine and my hair definitely needs conditioner after i wash it but i find that to be the case with most natural shampoos i don t think it lives up to its hydrating claims so i probably won t repurchase overall i prefer the avalon organics line of shampoos and conditioners because they have more natural plant based ingredients and aren t as fake smelling 
2011-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|unfortunately this was not the least bit hydrating in fact it did quite the opposite after every wash my hair felt unusually dry and brittle i even tried pre pooing with a hot oil treatment consisting of coconut and olive oil still dry i m talking sahara desert dry it also made my scalp itch which is extremely rare for me the smell was its only redeeming quality boo 
2011-08|2.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i picked this because i was looking for a sulfate free paraben free shampoo it is not hydrating my relaxed hair was parched after using this shampoo and conditioner combination i was prepared to donate it to a local shelter at my next trip until i decided to start using coconut and neem oil as a pre shampoo treatment the neem oil is good on hair but oh my word does it stink i use this as a lightly rinsing shampoo when doing that treatment because the minty smell removes the stench of the neem oil and my hair does not seem to lose the benefit of the prewash the way that the ion clarifying shampoo i used the first time in an attempt to get out the smell this is not hydrating at all but it is good for this one purpose i will probably look for something else when this runs out 
2011-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|this is the worst shampoo and conditioner i have ever used it made my hair dull and brittle my hair was so dry that it was difficult to brush because my hair would break and tangle i used it for two weeks and threw it out never again i have very thin oily hair so maybe it s just not for my hair type 
2011-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|i tried this shampoo with a few others from the organix line and this one was horrible with my oily hair it did not lather well it left residue and my hair felt like i had coated it in hairspray i do not use any products in my hair i did finish 3 4 of the bottle because for the price i couldn t justify throwing it out my husband used the rest and it worked well for him 
2011-08|4.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|bought this product during a bogo free sale at walgreens awhile back im interested by their sulfate free natural philosophy lt p gt the tea tree is their hydrating formula i would say that i love the smell and the lathering capabilities of the formula at first it was difficult to get a lather going and i would have to shampoo twice but now the trick is to rub and emulsify the product in your hands before you apply to your hair lt p gt the shampoo i feel moisturizes as much as a shampoo can get it s not super moist but i ve never found any shampoo to really do that it doesn t overly dry out my hair and preps it well for conditioner and styling lt p gt i don t mind the bottles too much i adore their use of disposable inks for their writing after a couple of uses you might notice some of the writing on your bottle is gone but hey that is a plus for the environment yays overall i would recommend his product to how interested in sulfate free products 
2011-08|1.0|Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo|at first i liked this shampoo but it has turned my hair to straw
2020-08|5.0|Niacin3 + Caffeine Shampoo|my hair used to fall quite a bit and i decided to use ogx after a friend recommended the brand she used miracle coconut i went to the hairdresser for a haircut and she asked if i d had my hair thinned recently because i had lots of short new growth i had never thinned my hair but i realised that this shampoo had really stimulated my hair growth my hair has grown by about 20 cm in a year after using various ogx products
2017-08|5.0|Niacin3 + Caffeine Shampoo|i love this and i have been noticing a lot less fall out than before though it doesn t really lather that well obviously because it is sulfate free if i wanted a shampoo to lather than i d get a shampoo that has sulfates 
2016-08|4.0|Niacin3 + Caffeine Shampoo|this shampoo is the best thing i have ever bought at target my hair has been thru a rough season it usually sheds a lot at the end of summer but not for months plus i had a lovely week in sept of combing and combing and more combing my hair for lice ugh anyway it is quite noticeable to me that it s been falling out too much hence my purchase of this shampoo just how it feels on my scalp is incredible but i think it really works too i m sensitive to supplements so i don t use this for every wash but i have seen less hairs in the shower drain when i do use this shampoo i will definitely keep a bottle on hand at all times

2020-08|5.0|Frizz Defy + Coconut Miracle Oil Air Dry Cream|my long and coarse hair has been a pain to manage at the best of times but after the uk stores struggled to stock any body care items for a few months early into covid making do with old shampoos amp conditioners from a pound shop has left my hair dry frizzy and quick to knot up i ve already chopped 6 inches off my formally elbow length hair and have been battling the urge to cut it to my shoulders frizz defy coconut miracle oil air dry cream to the rescue you apply a small amount to just washed still damp hair my hair is thick so for me it s one pump for the left half and one for the right and that s it just leave your hair to dry naturally the cream has a coconut fragrance that is hard to distinguish once the product has been applied apart from the occasional whiff when my hair blows into my face and my hands aren t left with a greasy film after applying the product which is a good sign i was stunned this is something that gives results from the first use onwards my hair is almost 100 frizz free feels very silky doesn t look lank or greasy doesn t tangle anywhere near as much and feels more lightweight than usual my hair has a kink to it and if i don t meddle with my hair whilst its drying the cream bolsters it if i keep brushing through the lengths as its drying my hair will be more or less straight and will stay that way til i wash it again 
2020-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|a very good conditioner which softens and moisturizes my hair i use it straight after the coconut milk shampoo it s quite emollient and rich in texture but yet doesn t leave my hair and scalp oily like most other conditioners do it also doesn t weight it down or make it frizzy not to mention it smells literally like heaven if you like coconut scented things then you ll love this my only wish is that it would last longer than the hour or so that it does price is also good i can usually pick up a 13 oz bottle for just under 6 usd from target which is brilliant value considering how long one bottle lasts for my only complaint has to be the bottle itself no matter how much i try and shake the conditioner out i just cannot get the last one fifth or so out of the bottle and end up cutting the bottle in half just to scoop out what s left not that this is a pricey conditioner i just don t like unnecessary wastage other than that it s hard to fault this and i ll definitely be re purchasing selena x my top 10 hg list as i ve tried 100 s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti aging serum divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference 
2019-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i would not recommend this conditioner it does not smell like good coconuts it has a gross almost sour smell to it the product is actually very watery and you have to use a lot to even get a little bit moisture i would not recommend buying this as it s expensive for the product considering how much you have to use 
2018-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this smells amazing it de tangled my curly coarse amp dry hair well enough but when my hair dried it poofed up into a frizz ball and turned crunchy then was dry for a week i had to clarify and deep condition repeatedly nothing redeeming about this one other than the scent this worked decently on my child with normal straight hair 
2018-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this conditioner seems to be the marmite of conditioners hate it or love it and no in between i no longer use organix shampoos as my hair gets quite oily and now that it s no longer dyed there s no reason for me to use sulphate free cleansers i have to shampoo amp rinse 2 to 3 times in the shower with sulphate free stuff as quite simply they are not as effective at stripping oil and build up from my scalp and hair if i want to protect hair colour s lifespan on my head then yes it s great but other than that it just wastes money i still use organix conditioners and leave in oils at the ends they just seem to agree with my fine wavy porous hair and don t weigh it down like crazy if your hair is coarser and less porous i e hair dyes show up on your hair less then this probably won t work for you and i can imagine it would be very underwhelming it s worth a try if you have fine hair like me as it won t leave a thick quot waxy quot coating like some conditioners the organix bottle shapes though oh my god it s worse for the conditioners since they are thicker and more viscous than the shampoos once they are half empty you need superhuman strength to squeeze the bottle hard enough to get some of the conditioner out wish organix would sort it out 
2017-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|the first time i used this product my hair was full and bouncy i have 2c 3a hair but after a few more uses i noticed my hair getting drier and drier i think it is a proteins in the product my hair doesn t usually react well to proteins i thought maybe there wouldn t be too much in this product and bought it based on other high reviews on another site 
2016-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i started using this because honestly my curls were limp and dry and it had the word milk in it milk to me in beauty products automatically screams hydrating so i bought it the smell is lovely tropical and clean however it the product itself isn t that amazing i would compare it to your standard low range conditioner i gave this another go when i travelled overseas to hawaii humid temps i was dreading the havoc it was about to do to my hair picked this up at a corner shop in a travel size and was disappointed again the hotels shampoo cond was better quality it s not horrible but for it s price it s underwhelming don t really waste your time on the coconut milk range as ogx has a lot of better products available 
2016-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|when i purchased this conditioner i loved the smell and i thought this was going to address all my hair concerns i used this conditioner in conjunction with the shampoo and the results weren t good i had frizzy static and very fluffy hair wouldn t purchase again 
2016-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i felt compelled to write a review on this conditioner because of how horrible it is i have literally bought conditioner that is 1 and it was much better than this i tried making this conditioner work i even used the whole bottle because i didn t want to waste it it did not make my hair silky nor smooth it did not detangle whatsoever it did not even feel like i had used conditioner and i left on my hair for the recommended time don t waste your money on this one guys i gave it two lippies because the smell is absolutely amazing this is the best smelling conditioner i ve probably ever tried but other than that it serves no purpose in my honest opinion 
2016-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i have damaged hair curly and thick and honestly this surprised me my hair feels so much better with this i definitely would recommend this to someone that has damaged hair been using this product for some time now 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|so i was shocked when i saw how low this was rated since i m on my third bottle but everyone s hair is different and we all have different preferences to review i rather enjoy this conditioner it has a slightly milky texture and runs pretty thin for a conditioner being aware that this is not a mask it does not intend to be very thick to begin with i enjoy the way this makes my hair feel and think it does a good job in working up a good slip in my hair without leaving it feeling gross afterwards not the best certainly not the worst recommendation target and ulta often have ogx products in the extra large 50 more free size so i always buy it there 
2015-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|it s strange to me that this has such low reviews i use this in conjunction with the coordinating shampoo and i absolutely adore it i ve tried dozens of other shampoo conditioner combos and i keep coming back to this i just bought my third bottle yesterday this conditioner has a great smell and medium consistency i have fine medium thick wavy hair and this product makes it so shiny and smooth it dry angles my long hair as well i apply this all over throw my hair up in a bun and let it soak in for about five minutes then i rinse it and immediately i feel the effects i love this and the matching shampoo so much i don t think i ll ever buy another kind 
2015-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i used this with the coordinating shampoo and i liked the shampoo but not this conditioner while i liked the smell and the thicker consistency of the shampoo i disliked the smell and the thin consistency of this conditioner the smell was fake and i usually need a bit of a thicker conditioner if i want to have any hope to reduce the static and frizz that comes with my fine hair and dry climate i will continue to use up this shampoo and conditioner but once i finish it i will not repurchase 
2015-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i have pretty thick hair that tangles as soon as it gets wet and this conditioner did absolutely nothing to detangle i had to use practically half the bottle just to get my hair manageable for combing it it has a nice smell but that s the only good quality if you have thick hair i would advise against this product 
2015-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|my husband purchased this conditioner for me from harmon as well as the shampoo and spray i love organix they are sulfate free animal cruelty free and they use recycled plastic for their packaging this conditioner smells so good now i know it says coconut milk but if you are not a coconut fan please try this i love coconut for the smell and coconut has a lot of healing properties for your hair skin and body this conditioner conditions without weighing hair down it s not watery or too thick i love it at harmon the 13oz size is 5 99 the 25 4 oz size is 10 99 they even have a 2oz size for 1 99 if you want to give it a try and throw it in your gym bag i have way thick hair and i honestly love the organix coconut milk line i have not flat ironed my hair all week that s a big deal i always flat my hair but the coconut milk line gives my hair shine body volume and my natural wavy hair comes out without looking crazy i recommend you give it a try if your hair is thick and wavy or just thick i really think you will like it 
2015-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i had high hopes for this for my frizzy hair and it did actually make it nice on the first wash i used this in conjuction with its matching shampoo a day later however my very dry hair somehow became greasy and flat i haven t used it since which is a shame because it smells really good would not repurchase this although i do own other products in their line that i like the argan oil shampoo conditioner as well as the anti breakage biotin spray amp sea spray are amazing 
2015-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|smells nice but dries my hair i have incredibly dry hair and this product manages to make it worse than cleaning it with plain water shame because i adore the scent but it s unsuitable 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i quite liked this as a conditioner but i didn t like the organix coconut milk shampoo counterpart it was way too heavy for my thin fine hair this conditioner smells great and moisturizes my hair pretty well i only condition the ends of my hair and this does it s job at detangling my hair is thin fine a little bit wavy and i thought that this conditioner was fine will probably repurchase if i don t find a better one to use 
2015-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this stuff is ridiculously overpriced in australia i grabbed a bottle of this conditioner on sale i love coconut scented things unfortunately this is where my praise ends i have long fine hair which is not particularly problematic except that it can tangle easily the description made this conditioner sound perfect for my hair type but i was really disappointed it simply does not detangle my hair and this can only cause damage in the long run i m not sure but maybe my hair and protein do not get along i also hate this packaging anything where i need to shake a bottle with wet hands to get product out gets a thumbs down from me i am now using this to shave my legs with it s really good for that at least 
2015-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i really wanted to like this conditioner i ve been on the hunt for one that would be moisturizing to my hair which likes to change from oily to very dry in a matter of a day it s very very annoying without being greasy with all the things i know about coconut being hydrating in general i was pretty excited to try out this conditioner i will say that it leaves my hair soft but the aftermath is a disaster no matter how long i stick my head under the shower head my hair will be piece y and unclean feeling when my hair is dry i usually try to wash my hair every two days or so but this conditioner made me feel bad going even a day the product packaging is the only thing i like about this conditioner although the wideness of it does make it a little hard to store 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner| same as my review for shampoo first time organix user i spent a lot of time wondering about this product i read a lot of reviews and finally bought as it was on sale at my local superstore along with the shampoo i d heard reviews of people noticing less hair loss and i noticed it too with the previous shampoo conditioner combo i was using i experienced a fair amount of hair loss breakage now next to none the scent is nice i m in love with a lot of stuff coconut and it s not overpowering i actually use the coconut water hydration oil if i want a little burst of scent i also love how much more nourished and stronger my hair seems my biggest flaws are the price anywhere from 6 11 depending where i go and if it s on sale and the fact that the bottles don t show how much is left if i have the money i d definitely repurchase i love how my hair feels afterwards 
2015-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i lucked out and got this conditioner for 4 on sale with coupons at walgreens i really like this my hair has gotten pretty long and now my hair has lost some of its volume this conditioner has totally fixed the problem not only does this smell like coconut amp vanilla yumminess it makes my hair soft strong and voluminous it s a very lightweight conditioner and also help with defining the waves and curls in my hair however i only get good results if i use a ton of it i m talking like golf ball size amount every time like what you would do with a deep conditioner i ve used it before only using a small quarter size amount and it wasn t moisturizing enough i absolutely love the results when i use it like a deep conditioner but it does feel like a waste of money but if i can keep getting it on sale i don t mind 
2015-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i love the smell of this product but thats pretty much it it didn t really moisturize that well i actually thought it was quite damaging to my hair so i wouldn t buy this again the smell gets an a it smells like a coconut cream pie 
2015-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|smells wonderful but doesn t detangle 
2015-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|as much as i love the smell and the cute packaging of this stuff i would not repurchase i have hair down the halfway mark of my back and this makes managing post shower hair almost impossible i love that the smell lingers but my hair feels like its been washed with a clarifying shampoo once this rinses out my giant bottles of aussie conditioner do a much better job at nearly half the cost and triple the product i love other organix products but this was a miss 
2015-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i had this conditioner and the shampoo in the back of my bathroom cabinet last time i had used it was when i still had very long hair it didn t do anything for me back then and it quietly found it s place between all the other discarded shampoos amp conditioners yesterday i was watching essie button s march favorites video and she mentioned this and as my hair is now only slightly longer than hers i thought i could give it a try again back when my hair was long i hated that it didn t moisturize enough and that it left my hair course but now with my lob it is perfect it makes my hair soft but not weighed down i actually can blow dry it and create volume without the use of an additional styling product this shampoo and conditioner have made it out of exile and have taken up residence in my shower 
2015-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|meh that s all i got to say in my experience it s not as bad as other reviewers are saying but it s not a good product either i love the smell smells like sweet coconut and not the beachy salty coconut smell of sunscreen but the smell doesn t linger in my hair i used the conditionner and the shampoo together for a while and my hair felt ok they were not really nourished by this product i will not buy again
2015-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i m so surprised to see this product has such low reviews because it really is a gem for me i can t believe i can buy it cheaply from my local pharmacy my hair is seriously hard work it s very fine stranded but thick in quantity curly dry and damaged from being highlighted blonde for over a decade all of which equal massively tangle prone i often got matts in my hair it would snap off when i tried to detangle i couldn t grow it i ve been a high end product junkie if you see the pictures in my profile there s one from a few years ago of my shelf stacked with kerastase redken bumble amp bumble joico philip kingsley products not pictured are the shu uemura and philip b products that cost a fortune i ve spent way too much on products after trying a very niche range the george michael line for long hair specially imported from germany which was lovely and finally got my hair to bsl but eye wateringly expensive i got a brazilian blowout and was given simple alterna products to use kicking my he junkie habit months after the blowout washed out i was still using the alterna products i eventually found i had run out and went to my local pharmacy to buy emergency conditioner i needed moisture and love the smell of coconut so went for this i was very happy with the results so have kept it at the centre of my haircare routine this conditioner has clicked in as the final and yay affordable piece of the jigsaw of my perfect hair routine i still use the alterna bamboo shampoo and follow it with a generous walnut sized squeeze of conditioner i leave it in 5 minutes while brushing my teeth and washing my face i then take my tangle teezer my hair by this point is totally softened and comb through my hair in the shower i rinse out the conditioner and my hair naturally dries into soft silky loose curls it smells lovely too i have to wash my hair every other day to keep the silkiness but i m fine with this as it prevents matts forming the real miracle for me is that i can get a silky blow dry finish with absolute minimal effort which i never thought would happen i use a smoothing product either kerastase elixir ultime or kms smoothing creme then alternate brushing through with a paddle brush and blasting with the dryer towards the end i give some shape with a round bristle brush it takes 15 minutes and doesn t look frizzy fuzzy as my diy blowdries always used to look it looks smooth i have owned both my styling products for longer than this conditioner and only in combination with it have they been so effective so i m giving the bulk of the credit to organix for complete disclosure i also take phytophanere supplements and occasionally do oil treatments with coconut oil or pure argan oil perhaps every couple of months so this conditioner forms part of a repertoire of products for me but it stands out as the only product to help me conquer tangles a saviour and get a silky blow dry a real first for me and all for 7 99 about a third of the price of my average product before i m a very happy customer 
2015-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this conditioner is the best thing i have ever used its the holy grail for my hair i love it soooo much first off before i bought this product my hair was so dry and frizzy one week later my hair is full of shine repaired and my hair is even healthier by trimming it and using the macadamia hair mask i love this product so much and the best part is that its not to pricey 
2014-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i think this is a good conditioner and combined with the shampoo it s great i think as with any product it is best to use the entire line shampoo conditioner to get the best result i like the smell and i don t normally use products with fragrance but i have had no problem with this one i will buy this one again 
2014-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|along with the shampoo this stuff is terrible the coconut smell is incredibly strong and stays in my hair for days even when i co wash with this conditioner my hair still is dry and frizzy and is unable to hold a curl at the same time it leaves my hair kinky and feeling greasy this product has done so much damage to my hair that i ve had to trim the ends off from them being so kinky my hair used to curl beautifully and now i m still in repair mode even after not using this stuff for 3 weeks i ll never use this stuff again 0 10 
2014-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i currently have the shampoo and the conditioner and in my opinion its not the best out there because it makes my hair smooth and smells good for only 2 days and then the next it will start to get dry again i will not be purchasing this shampoo conditioner ever again 
2014-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|not for thick hair this conditioner is very light this might be a better solution for someone with thin hair one positive smells very good will be returning back to target 
2014-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i bought this a few days ago along with the shampoo i will keep updating since i want to give my hair time to adjust to the shampoo and conditioner i used it for the second time today and i love the thick consistency of the conditioner the smell is divine but i will do another review on this in a month or two peace p s i think it also would be good to switch to a clarifying shampoo once a week so the coconut milk shampoo won t cause unnecessary build up which i will do 
2014-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this conditioner smells divine i have very fine hair that grows thickly so it s a nightmare of tangles and this stuff cuts through although i recently cut off my long hair i still use it on my short hair to smoothe it and it does wonders cons it s expensive and the product is not easy to get out of the bottle i would repurchase though 
2014-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|first of all the smell of this product is absolutely divine it s probably the best smelling conditioner i ve tried the consistency is very thick and lush which i like but the bottle is a little awkward and it s hard to get the product out it would probably be better in a tube or something the effects aren t really anything special it smooths my hair but doesn t work any miracles in terms of moisture i really love the smell but i probably won t buy it again when i run out unless i see it on sale or something this conditioner isn t bad but it s nothing special either 
2014-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this conditioner and shampoo are my favorites out of the organix line i hated coconut with a passion but sucked it up for the sake of my hair and i totally fell in love with coconut oil the shampoo cleanses my hair without drying out my scalp and this conditioner hydrated my hair back to baby soft glory that doesn t break or shed as much the only downside is that if i put it on my roots my hair can look slightly oily so i keep it mostly at my ends but that s with any conditioner the scent lingers for a bit too and despite being quot fake coconut quot it still made me feel like a tropical princess each time i cleansed my hair i now use coconut and monoi oil too i ve used other shampoos conditioners on my hair but i keep coming back to this one because it works for me and it s been a year this is the first shampoo conditioner i ve really liked 
2014-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|so surprised by the low score this conditioner is excellent on my hair i use virgin coconut oil as an overnight conditioning treatment once a week and it s so good for defining my wavy hair and getting rid of the frizz so i looked for coconut anything to use in between this smells amazing and has smoothed out my hair brilliantly so has done the job love it 
2014-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|love this conditioner it s quite light but still works well great fragrance a bit pricy but lasts me awhile as i only wash every four days i d definitely get this again 
2014-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i like coconut fragrance but this product has a fake coconut smell also when i used this on my ends and went to comb my shoulder length hair there were still tangles just not worth it 
2014-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i m surprised to see all the negative reviews i really like this conditioner i have been searching for one that doesn t take forever to rinse out and i have found it it smells delicious and is not too heavy or too light will definitely purchase again great price great value 
2014-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this was not nearly conditioning enough there was no slip to the hair at all for such a small bottle for the price i would expect this do to something other than smell good i would not repurchase any of these 
2014-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i been using this conditioner also the shampoo for almost a week already so far so good my hair is black straight amp thin hispanic my hair useto fall of dts y i been searchinh for a good shampoo pantene dove nuthing worked out so i got dis product nd its been workin great my hair feels thicker nd soft nd i been seen dis wavy curls in my ends i love it hopefully it will continue dis way i just love my hair dis time amp amp also the price aint bad i got it on cvs 
2014-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this product happens to not be very moisturizing at all there is barely any slip or conditioning to my hair felt with this conditioner in it i bought it once and have no plans on buying it again 
2014-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i love this product i use it with the shampoo as well it s literally the only stuff that works in my hair and the scent is great 
2014-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|due to the mixed and iffy reviews of this i came across trial sized bottles of this and the matching shampoo at walmart to try out the coconut scent is wonderful lt 3 this along with the matching shampoo is just amazing i have 3b naturally spiral curly hair that is dry and dyed this conditioner really made my hair feel soft and moisturized plus less frizz i love it i used my trial sized bottles for almost a week and got so many compliments on my hair 100 repurchasing and getting the big bottles 
2014-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i love the smell of conditioner but its not my favorite of their s
2014-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i absolutely love this conditioner and shampoo doesn t make my hair greasy or oily and i have very thick oil prone hair this detangles smells amazing and is affordable great product overall can t go without it 
2013-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|horrible there s absolutely organic or natural about this brand this conditional did nothing for hair it just sat on top of it it doesn t absorb moisturize or detangle don t waste your money on this it s extremely over priced lol at the line being called quot organix quot 
2013-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i love this conditioner it s the only conditioner i have used that doesn t dry out my coarse thick dry frizzy hair it doesn t weigh it down and it actually hydrates my hair not just coat it with silicone i use it with the shampoo and serum and it s awesome i m already on my 3rd bottle the only con is that the conditioner always runs out before the shampoo update i still love this conditioner it s just i ve found a way more hydrating one from the drugstore the aveeno pure naturals seaweed one i just love the way the scent lingers in my hair and it smells so good 
2013-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i don t understand al of the awful reviews on this product and the horrendous rating i bought a little travel sized version of this last night because my husband and i stayed the night without planning in a different state i refuse to use hotel shampoo and conditioner ick this smelled amazing and felt really good on my hair i left it in for about 10 minutes like i do with any conditioner and when i rinsed out it felt soft as silk when wet and really smooth when dry i even blow dryed it and my hair tends to get frizzy so yeah i liked this quite a bit only 3 star rating cuz i have to use it more to decide just how much i like it
2013-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this smells so good and the product feels like it rinses clean and its fairly inexpensive the positives end there this conditioner just isn t rich enough i tried using a ton of it and leaving it in for longer than 5 minutes to see if that would help moisturize my hair it made no difference i feel like this product may be even damaging my hair since i can t get a comb through it after my shower and when i do it pulls it out will be using the remainder of this for shaving since i bought the salon size bottle i don t want to just toss it 
2013-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|absolutely love this i have used organix coconut shampoo and conditioner for at least 6 months my hair is thick coarse and naturally curly but i have it straightened before using organix products due to many times of hair permanent straightening and colour dyeing my hair was so dry and not shiny at al i was looking and trying so many products including high end expensive ones like loreal profestional goldwell kerastase and some else i don t remember but none of them improve the condition of my hair until i try organix coconut at first i was reluctant to try it cause i tried organix cherry blossom before and it dried out my hair however the chemist store around my area had it in a cheap deal so i decided to give it a try and my first experience with organix coconut was seriously amazing my hair looks clean hydrated straight and shiny especially my hair lost condition immediately disappeared after the first use this is amazing cause i used to have a lot of hair lost highly recommend 
2013-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i have really dry ends of my hair my hair length is somewhere between my waist and hips and this manages to make my ends feel amazing not to mention the smell lasts ages ive died my hair around 6 or 7 times in the last year including bleaching the ends and then dying them blue purple red as well as black and brown and my hair feels as good as it did before i was dying it heaps i definitely will be buying this again and again its almost perfect for my hair 
2013-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|an overwhelming quot meh quot my hair always gets more staticky in the fall winter so i was looking for a product that would help with that this didn t damage my hair but it didn t help it at all i didn t like the texture of the product either it was too thick almost kind of grainy and really difficult to get out of the bottle it s also expensive for a little amount of product there are better things than this out there 
2013-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|the smell is sooo yummy not the point though lol it was really nourshing and i have reason to believe it actually repaired damage it made my hair super soft and silky as well as shiny i have medium textured thick hair and it also helped my hair stay straight all day it helped a lot with frizz too and i know frizz i have curly hair lol worth the price love this conditioner 
2013-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|for your consideration i have a lot of hair thick somewhat course with a lot of volume very wavy and partially curly i have used pureology redken pantene tresseme this conditioner is just below equal or equal to my other stuff it was amazing at sealing me split ends and conditioning the inch left in my hair that is still color treated i use this after my other brand salon shampoo and the conditioner works really good whether i use a sulfate free or sulfate formula it is not heavy on my hair at all and i do not notice buildup the results were best when i started using the organix coconut milk leave in cream i will review that too 
2013-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|i do not like the conditinoer at all i feel like i didnt even use it and only used shampoo does nothing for my hair the shampoo isnt bad i didnt even finish the bottle and i threw it away worst organix product 
2013-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this is a exellent product very good to revive dry dull hair sure did wonders to my hair 
2013-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|this was crap it like sat on my hair and rinsed off after the smell is yummy but not worth purchasing don t buy this 
2013-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner|best conditioner for curly hair i will never use anything else again it s thick and creamy so it completely coats the hair plus it smells amazing 
2020-08|5.0|Sea Salt Spray|it helps my hair hold texture and smells amazing could be used as a hair perfume as well 
2016-08|4.0|Sea Salt Spray|let s face it my hair is generally a lost cause it s very fine and very slick doesn t hold style for long this spray gives me all day texture and body without the goopy and or crusty feeling of most styling products it actually makes my hair feel thicker smells great too i will sometimes use this in conjunction with the organix bamboo fiber full root boost spray which also smells fantastic and they add manageable body and texture to my often boring hair only con is the packaging the bottle can be a bit hard to hold after a while it easily implodes due to the suction from the spray and the lack of air making its way back into the bottle if you release the top after every use it keeps the bottle plump which is easier to hold just a bit of an inconvenience 
2015-08|4.0|Sea Salt Spray|i love love this because it smells great and it doesnt make my hair weird or crunchy like some sprays but it doesn t also do anything special to it other than make it shiny and nice smelling which is what i use it for anyway if you re looking for a beachy look the john frieda version of this works well for me 
2015-08|4.0|Sea Salt Spray|to start off i bought this product at my local cvs as a summer alternative to my usual curl cream the price was decent on par with any other organix product i would buy it again once i run out i have extremely wavy hair with some defined curl i used this product like i would do with any other curl product i use on nearly sopping wet hair the smell is just wonderful i wish there was a perfume with this scent i like that it s in the spray bottle no sticky hands or having to worry about quot slip quot it does not work well on already dry or mostly dry hair it makes my hair feeling dry and tangled if you do want to purchase this product use it on hair that s come right out of the shower and scrunch lightly i usually scrunch up around my roots to give me some lift and then twist strands around a finger to define waves as i don t have straight hair or have had any friends with straight hair try it i don t know how it works with it if anything it might be a good texture spray and scent 
2015-08|4.0|Sea Salt Spray|the smell of this is intoxicating beachy without overloading the coconut along the lines of the moroccanoil scent which i love but less candylike it works well as a perk up for my too soft curly hair that can go limp when there is too little humidity could work on sopping wet hair to intensify curl seems to be going up in price 
2015-08|3.0|Sea Salt Spray|i got this on sale i have thick wavy hair and i guess i ll just have to accept that my favorite beach spray l oreal everstyle in the purple bottle that smells soooo good is just never going to be made again this is actually ok it hasn t been giving my hair a whole lot of texture but it hasn t been making it crazy frizzy either the smell is pretty wonderful too not a huge fan of organix ogx products in general and i ll have to update later but get it on sale it s alright 
2014-08|3.0|Sea Salt Spray|i thought this product would be perfect for me because i normally spray the ogx moroccan argan oil weightless healing dry oil on my hair first followed by not your mother s beach babe sea salt spray a combo which gives my thick wavy hair the best quot beachy quot look so when i found this product by ogx that combined the moroccan oil with the salt spray i thought i d be in heaven especially because i absolutely love every other ogx product i ve ever used however i do not like this product at all it makes my hair feel dry straw like and really frizzy my hair appears fried whenever i use this product the only way i can use it is if i apply a good amount of moisturizing serum i like giovanni frizz be gone to the ends before i spray the salt spray all over i will not repurchase the ogx salt spray i highly recommend not your mother s beach babe salt spray over this 
2014-08|3.0|Sea Salt Spray|it is ok too much in my hair makes it crunchy but too little doesn t give me any wave i think this may be for people who already have some wave my hair is just to straight to scrunch i do looove the smell so i use it as a light texturizing spray when i put my hair up 
2013-08|1.0|Sea Salt Spray|this is unfortunately one of those cheap products that doesn t match up to it s expensive competitors bumble amp bumble surf spray is by far better than this you d think the solution wouldn t be that complicated but i swear b amp b surf spray is worth it s price this stuff did not hold the waves in place it made my hair extremely dry and crunchy as if i sprayed hairspray starch in it within hours my hair just looked like i got electrocuted far from the beachy boho waves i was going for this isn t worth my experience with the organix brand so far has not been good their products are cool in concept but poor in performance 
2013-08|4.0|Sea Salt Spray|not sure if its gimmicky or not but i bought it right before a florida vacation loved loved loved it i have curly textured hair and this gave it a really fun shape and feel i try not to fight the midwestern humidity either and paired with confixor gel from aveda it gave me the right look and control as well 
2020-08|3.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|typical 
2020-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|excellent this is much more effective at what it s supposed to do than the macadamia oil shampoo i ll probably have to pair this with the coconut milk shampoo my fave from the ogx shampoo line up so far the macadamia oil conditioner leaves my hair tangle free and nicely moisturized without weighing it down the texture is quite thick in comparison to other conditioners and silky i apply from a few mm above the roots right through to the ends focusing on the ends especially and leave it on for about 5 minutes before rinsing out and allowing my hair to dry naturally smells absolutely gorgeous resulting in equally lovely smelling hair and doesn t leave my hair oily nor flat excellent for taming frizz too will re purchase selena x my top 10 hg list as i ve tried 100 s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti aging serum divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference 
2018-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i m on my third bottle of this stuff this is legit my hg conditioner i have thin brittle hair with frizzy ends and nothing has worked better for me 
2016-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|this is the best conditioner i ve ever bought my hair was pretty damaged and since the first wash it felt soft healthier and shinny one tip if you use it with the macadamia shampoo combo just apply the shampoo in the roots don t spread it because it will dry your hair wash it off then use the conditioner all over your hair leave it for 5 minutes and you ll have amazing results 
2014-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|very awkward shaped bottle but it s what inside that counts right on my over bleached extremely damaged hair this was pure heaven since my hair was so ruined i used it to co wash my hair after the first use my hair was smooth silky and tangle free as hair should be the next few times i used it i was still very pleased with the result but i began to notice a build up on my roots that felt oily to the touch this was the only product i used on my hair at the time nothing a gentle shampoo didn t sort though the scent could be better overall i was happy with the performance of this i think next time i buy it it ll be for the rare occasions i use shampoo i found it a bit heavy to be used by itself 
2014-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|first off i have had relaxed hair for about 2 3 years it s damaged but like a 75 25 witch is good to me and i have a build up problem so my hair is oily most of the time amp the first wash with this was on oily hair my hair was so soft an bouncy the next washes where just left with really dry hair unless i prepoo the day before with coconut oil then my hair is really soft but i would buy again 
2014-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i have bleached amp damaged hair this product does a great job of making my hair appear healthy my hair is also really dry this product has great quot slip quot and it definitley feels more like an oil when you are applying it than a typical conditioner because of this you really need to make sure you rinse it out properly i m not really keen on the smell but it doesn t last anyway once i have sprayed heat protection in afterwards it has lasted me a long time as well as you only need a small amount 
2014-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i bought this bogo 50 off at ulta this is my favorite conditioner from the organix line and one i keep coming back to because of the slip you have to make sure to really rinse it out well however the extra time is worth it for me it has a creamy consistency dark yellow color and smells wonderful the scent does not linger unfortunately once my hair dries fully but i can tolerate that it leaves my hair with great shine and softness and does feel very moisturizing my hair air dries less frizzy and with good texture my curls look more bouncier it is a light protein conditioner with keratin so if protein sensitive you may not like this too much 
2014-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|my favorite conditioner now this is very thick and creamy it really does hydrate and make my hair smooth and very shiny i have thick coarse wavy and long hair and this seriously makes a huge difference in how it looks and feels i love organix and love how everything they have is sulfate free and wont damage my color the price can t be beat for what it has in it and what it does 5 99 always well spent on their products macadamia is awesome for the hair and my hair loves it more than any other oil 
2013-08|3.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i was really needing a hydrating conditioner for my dry ends and this was not it it left me really dry i did however love the smell and it had great slip i will use the rest for pre shampoo treatments 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|love it 
2013-08|2.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i have long thick slightly wavy hair and it is not been chemically treated but it is dry and has split ends i was recommened macademia oil and with my good experience with the moroccan argan oil mist i decided to try this conditioner out now this one is suppose to moisturise with macademia oil and treat the split ends with the help of sugar cane when i used it and washed it off i felt it had no effect and it left a sort of residue in my hair it has a great smell but i don t think it has any effect on me and thats disappointing 
2013-08|1.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|this is the worst conditioner i have ever used it is so runny and liquidy and it does nothing for my long coarse curly hair conditioners should condition hair and make your hair look better but this one made my hair look frizzier and dryer than before i would give it zero stars if i could that s how bad it is 
2013-08|2.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i was looking to this conditioner to maybe replace my pureology hydrate set since those are so expensive but this conditioner really didn t do much for my hair at all i was disappointed because while it did sort of condition my hair it left my hair very thick and very easily tangled my hair is slightly thick already and tangles easily already and i feel like this just exacerbated all the bad qualities i think this would work really well as a thickening sort of conditioner for thinner hair types it wasn t a hit for me 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|my boyfriend purchased this conditioner for me so i tried it the next day and i was really happy with it the conditioner itself is pleasantly lightweight so i felt it d be easily absorbed by my hair after i rinsed my hair felt great and it looked shiny great product

2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|this review is for both the shampoo and conditioner because i use them together i am always willing to try new products once i run out of whatever i ve been using so when i looked up reviews for organix and saw that this particular line got good reviews i decided to give it a go i m so glad i did it s unlike anything else i ve tried in that the shampoo lathers very well for a sulfate paraben free product at least compared to others i ve tried and the conditioner really feels more like a creamy oil it smells yummy and left my hair feeling very pampered silky and shiny even though it doesn t leave my hair feeling weighed down i will still use a clarifying shampoo cond once a week to keep it from getting any build up 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i am an employee at walgreens so when i saw that organix line was on sale bogof i decided to give it a go last time i used organix i received the cherry blossom ginseng shampoo and conditioner as a gift it was absolutely horrible i have very color treated wavy curly medium thickness hair every time i use cream conditioners they tend to be way to heavy on my hair and leave the roots greasy my hair will feel like it hasn t been cleaned for weeks but after watching many beauty gurus on youtube anything with macadamia oil seemed to be considered god sent so i immediately decided to choose the macadamia shampoo and conditioner from the organix line best decision i ve made in a while i noticed the difference immediately just by the texture of the conditiner in my hand it has a very slick feel to it you can definitely feel the oil in it i put a rather large helping of this conditioner in my hair in the shower and left it on for about five minutes when i washed it out i could feel the oil slicked in my wet hair and it got me worried but when my hair dried it was so shiny and soft the oil is so light that it gives your hair a shiny finish it s not heavy at all so it didn t weigh down my hair and make it feel greasy it gave my hair a nice coat of polish that s how i look at it i absolutely love it i ve been using it everyday for about 6 months now an it s my new favorite i never have an issue with buildup or any irritation with the scalp i would definitely recommend this conditioner and will be purchasing again 
2013-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i loved how soft and silky this made me hair feel after being very disappointed by the moroccan argan oil shampoo and conditioner i told myself not to buy any organix shampoo conditioners but this one is absolutely fantastic it does not have a very strong scent but the scent is nice i am not a fan of the packaging because of the size of the bottle but the product inside makes up for it i like using this with the clear voluminzing root boost shampoo although using it with the organix macadamia shampoo works well too 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|this product along with the matching shampoo made my hair so pretty i have normal wavy dyed hair maybe a little on the drier side because of styling tools i used it in combination with the keratin oil anti breakage and flat iron mist also from organix and was really surprised on how glossy and manageable it left my hair without weighing it down it might not work for everyone but i do love it 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|this is very very good smoothing hydrating softening the scent is just like the oil and shampoo and i would definitely recommend it love the macadamia line 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i love this conditioner it s a pity it s so expensive in australia more than 2x the price in the us it smells fantastic leaves my thin fine hair smooth manageable and shiny and smelling lovely not at all like the cloying scents of most conditioners plus some really good ingredients i also love the look of the bottle though a tube would probably have been easier to get all the product out also i like packaging that allows me to see how much product is left even so if this is on sale i will definitely repurchase edit yay found this on sale and rebought it it really is good 
2012-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i have the argan one from organix and i wanted to try this one because i heard good things about it as well overall i like this better as an in shower conditioner but i like to put a little in through my hair after i get out and this can t be used like that argan can i love love love the smell of this and how soft it makes my hair in the shower i think ill be using this as my conditioner and the argan version as a blowout cream 1 lippie because i can t use this product for both purposes 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i love this conditioner it makes my hair super soft i use this along with the intensive moisture mask its a life saver for my somewhat dry hair try this please you wont be disappoited 
2012-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|my bf bought this s amp c set to use when i stay there i asked for the awauphi ginger one i d been hears so much about but it was oos i just finished the conditioner and i m impressed the shampoo was gentle and didn t dry out my dry curly color treated hair it really feels like it needs conditioning after using the shampoo but this replenishes it well its not super thick do was skeptical but as long as i use my leave in conditioner before styling its all good my fair feels so soft and light but still manageable my only gripe i tend to get build up after a few uses and need to clarify not sure if its the oils or if its because the shampoo is so gentle that it doesn t remove all my styling products but that s not a big deal i would repurchase still kinda think its expensive but not gonna kill your wallet 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|nothing short of amazing i purchased the entire set and i can say that the conditioner beats redkin 5th ave avocado treatment conditioner and frederick fekkai s glossing cream with the shea butter lt yes my hair type highly dry hair from living in the desert results silky shiny hair that comes out super soft i m able to run my fingers through it and it s amazingly shiny in conclusion i m impressed i found the ingredients to be highly eye catching so i had to jump at the chance to give this a try it s wonderful for dry and or damaged hair my results are as stunning as walking out of one of my most favorite salon trips it s must have i will be trying the other choices on the shelf i will note that i did use the shampoo with the conditioner economy although it comes in a 13 oz bottle a little go s a very long way even so it s worth every dime 1 bottle can range from 7 99 to 9 50 us price once in awhile you can catch a deal such as purchasing 1 bottle getting another free lt at any local walgreens the bottle itself is eco friendly to add to that the results are fabulous for me it s worth every cent plus some considering i was back and forth to other salon hair products that cost twice as much i consider it a fabulous deal for animal lovers like myself not tested on animals some ingredients aloe leaf extract coconut oil macadamia seed oil keratin bamboo extract cocoa seed butter and avocado oil
2012-08|2.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|this condioner is such a great find it makes my hair really shiny and soft i use it after the matching shampoo and it doesn t seem all that moisturizing at first and doesn t give much slip you have to leave it on for 3 5 minutes like the bottle says after that time it made my hair like silk some conditioners leave your hair feeling super soft and moisturized others leave your hair strong smooth and shiny this is the latter and it adds just enough weight to keep my slightly wavy hair from frizzing it smells like candy and the price is good too i will definitely keep this in my rotation love this stuff update this ended up really drying my hair out i think it s all the silicones 
2012-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i have color treated and bleached curly wavy hair i use my straightener way too often needless to say my hair is damaged i bought this last week and left it in for 20 minutes i did not notice a huge difference i used it last night as a leave in a washed it out this morning my hair feels soft and most importantly moisturized it feels a bit greasy but i prefer that over dry hair it may be because i did not wash all of it out either way this stuff seems to do a good job 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i have fine hair and lots of it that damages easily it s hard to find conditioner and shampoo that softens protects and doesn t cause build up my favorite shampoo used to be redken all soft but after i ran out i wanted to try something sulfate free after reading how bad it is organix and l oreal were brands recommended and easily accessible walmart target especially for a busy mom after my first few uses i love it and my hair is soft and shiny and my split ends aren t as noticeable must be something with the oils i ll report back in a few weeks if anything changes 
2012-08|1.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|this dried my hair out terribly i used both the shampoo amp conditioner and my hair was extremely dry afterwards i used it for 2 weeks amp after switching back to my suave naturals the problem went away immediately it costs way too much for what it is amp there is not that much in there 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|i normally really do not like to condition my hair with regular drugstore conditioners because i feel as though they don t really do anything for my hair i usually use a hair mask or coconut oil for my curls this conditioner on the other hand is great i washed my hair with the matching shampoo then i put the conditioner in my hair for about 10 minutes it smells great but it made my curls very soft and manageable i was able to comb out my hair without too much effort or breakage i m very pleased with this line from organix 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|picked this up today and just used it have to say i m pleasantly surprised i bought the matching shampoo and the macadamia dry styling oil i used all three and just let my hair air dry usually i m still pretty frizzy when i air dry even especially since my coppola express is fading but my hair actually looks soft and shiny didn t weigh my hair down like most other oil shampoo conditioners like morroccan oil 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|fantastic conditioner i use it in conjunction with the shampoo and occasionally the dry oil from the same collection and they are all great it smells really good leaves my hair soft shiny and very cooperative highly recommended 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|wow this is amazing i also use the shampoo my hair has never been so soft and shiny in all honesty my hair has never been shiny the conditioner is creamy and amazing the smell is fabulous too it lingers in you hair as well if i could give it 6 lippies i would

2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Conditioner|this is a great conditioner for my colored hair which feels coarse after shampooing this conditioner really makes my hair soft and shiny and also seemed to give it extra body even though i put a lot of conditioner on my hair is very fine and gets greasy very quickly but despite really layering on this conditioner it doesn t weigh my hair down at all the benefits of this also seem to last when i don t use it also i last used this two days ago and although i have shampooed my hair since then my hair is still looking very healthy and shiny very happy with this product and would buy again 
2020-08|3.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i tend to find ogx s shampoos and conditioners are either a hit or a miss for me this one seems to sit somewhere in the middle it does a decent enough job at cleaning my hair without leaving it lank or frizzy it smells gorgeous and it doesn t weigh my hair down at all but there are a couple of issues firstly i struggle to get the shampoo out once past the halfway mark really wish it came with a pump dispenser rather than a flip top lid secondly i find that over time it doesn t clean or remove build up well enough which is when i notice the return of the itchy scalp and dandruff problem the only way i could keep using this is by alternating every few days with a clarifying shampoo or by adding a small amount of organic acv to it in the palm of my hand before applying to hair scalp not bad but i m unlikely to re purchase selena x my top 10 hg list as i ve tried 100 s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti aging serum divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference 
2018-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|most ogx shampoos are very drying and their conditioners not moisturising enough this particular one is one of the exceptions the shampoo feels moisturising and doesn t strip my hair the way the other ones do i feel like it s infused with more moisturising factors and it feels like it s a milder gentler formula on both the hair and the scalp after finishing the bottles i found that generally my hair was healthier to look at and not as frizzy it looked shinier silkier there was definitely some improvement this is one of the few ogx shampoo conditioner combos that i would buy again 
2016-08|2.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|been seeing this in the shops for a while but the price put me off buying it our local supermarket had some reduced to clear so i grabbed some i am pleased that i did not pay full price as it was not a good buy used shampoo and conditioner the other night and although the shampoo felt nice to use one of the products left my hair feeling very dry i do have dry damaged fine hair and this made it worse it also made my blonde a bit yellow enough for me to notice immediately the change in colour a real shame as i had high hopes going by the reviews 
2015-08|3.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|first of all the scent is horrible i swear it smells like insecticide to me nasty i must say though this has been the most hydrating organix shampoo i have tried the problem is that my hair gets oily very quickly with this shampoo 
2015-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i have used the matching conditioner for this for a long time but never really wanted to use the shampoo i just thought it would be really thick and heavy and make my hair really oily but i was so wrong i wish i had tried it sooner i am a bit on the fence with organix shampoos on the one hand they are one of the few brands that don t make my scalp itch or give me dandruff in fact the sea mineral shampoo actually worked for me as a anti dandruff shampoo so that s pretty good if you have dandruff but don t want to use the chemicals in the usual anti dandruff shampoos but there is sometimes something not quite right about them too drying or doesn t feel like it cleans properly builds up too much etc but this shampoo turned out to be quite light and thin and spread through my hair easily and lathered well and it s left my hair shiny and moisturised without being oily and i still have volume in my hair so it s perfect actually my hair is also a bit damaged at the ends from straightening it and this had made a really big difference whether it will build up over time i don t know but still you just have to alternate with a different one to fix that so yeah if you have every considered buying it and you like the conditioner it s worth giving it a go 
2015-08|2.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|this is not my favorite shampoo but i do like the smell of it it smells something along the lines of brown sugar it s nothing to write home about it is a creamy shampoo so not much lather but it gets the job done i wish the smell would linger in my hair will not repurchase
2015-08|2.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|it takes alot of the product to really lather in your hair and i use this with the matching conditioner and my hair did not feel hydrated or soft at all its more like the opposite 
2015-08|4.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because i read on a forum for people with curly hair that this shampoo is good for controlling frizz and making curls look defined i was skeptical at first when i noticed that liquid silicone is one of the first ingredients before macadamia oil but it works really well my hair is really shiny and my curls are well defined i put a dab of it back in my hair after i rinse it so that it controls frizz better and it works really well it also helps make it more manageable if i rinse it out completely i get knots in my hair it might seem expensive but it s worth it the bottles only look small because of the shape one thing they could improve is the shape of the cap it would be nice if i could stand it upside down when it s almost empty so i can get the last little bit out of the bottle easier 
2014-08|3.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|to be fair im only giving a lukewarm review amp not repurchasing bc my hair is color treated w semiperm sebastian cellophane this means i should only use the gentlest of non sulfate shampoos this not being one of them if you ve seen my recent reviews you know ive been careful by using dry shampoos so i was horrified to see 3 weeks in using this shampoo that my color was 75 stripped w gray shoots sticking out to embarrass me however if you do not have color this is a nicely tropical scented shampoo that cleanses your hair well unfortch i must move on to something gentler 
2014-08|4.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i have been wanting to try this for a while it smells very good and does a good job of getting my hair and scalp clean without making my hair feel stripped despite the fact that it has a harsh sulfate in it which is surprising since it claims to be sulfate free it leaves my hair shiny with good definition suitable for those with fine to medium hair it doesn t leave any residue and a bottle was about eight dollars wait for it to come on sale 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i think this beats out my hg shampoo organix brazilian straight it s super creamy and without conditioner my hair already feels very soft and moisturized i haven t had that feeling with many shampoos it smells awesome and with the conditioner my hair is very soft and sleek i have very thick wavy coarse and long hair i find many products do not do much for it usually they feel like they ve stripped my hair or have done nothing this is unique 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i have long fine easy to frizz straight asian hair while my scalp is on the oily side i shampoo my hair daily so i use a lot of shampoo and i need something that will clean my scalp but the same time it won t weight down my hair and control the frizz i ve been using organix hair products since about a year ago and i ve tried many of them i m completely hooked this is the only brand of hair products i m using now besides few other products from loreal originally i choose organix for the reason of sulfate free and loreal eversleek for silicone free all organix shampoo i ve tried are good some of them like the argan cream one is on the heavier side my most favorite so far are the macadamia oil shampoo for its smell and the sea mineral shampoo for its result but it smells not so good in my opinion macadamia oil shampoo smells just like fresh sugarcane and or real watermelon juice i m a taiwanese and both sugarcane and watermelon are very common fruits there it s a scent hard to describe not perfumy not floral not fruity not nutty although it s macadamia oil not really grassy but a bit green not sugary ok i m not being any helpful here this is the only shampoo i ve used in my whole life that will bring a smile on me when i use it in shower everyday for its smell result wise it s as good as all other organix shampoo i ve tried and they are all very good 
2013-08|1.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i have thick coarse dry hair and growing out my natural hair color so it was starting to get healthy however it did need its moisture and shine so i decided to try this organix macadamia oil shampoo mess well it did make my hair very soft and shiny but also made it very frizzy with static i have never had static in my hair this also made my scalp very oily a day after shampoo since i have dry hair and scalp it takes forever for it to get oily with this shampoo no conditioner my scalp was just gross oily the morning after it was terrible now i switched back to my usual shampoo which has no moisture for my coarse hair but my hair is still very very frizzy and with static please avoid this i live in humid east texas and this did not help but made it worse i have never experienced this with a shampoo if i could give it 1 lippie i would 
2013-08|4.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|this product is good i don t really think it is anything special though it smells great it leaves some tangles and isn t very moisturizing i would re purchase if it were on a good sale but if not i will try something else 
2013-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i absolutely love this shampoo i saw that there were a lot of negative reviews claiming that it dried out people s hair so i was hesitant about buying it but i m glad i did because it works great for me this shampoo in combination with the macadamia conditioner has made my thick frizzy wavy hair soft and manageable i guess it all depends on hair type so if your hair type is like mine i think you ll like it 
2013-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|this shampoo is really good i have brown curly color treated hair before using this my hair was dull wavy almost straight and really dry i haven t tried the conditioner i use the macadamia oil one but the shampoo has improved my hair condition is curly again and shiny 
2013-08|1.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|this has got to be the worst shampoo i have ever tried complete waste of 10 bucks i have long curly coarse hair and i thought it would moisturize my hair and it actually made my hair look worse and frizzier than ever i gave it to my sister who has fine hair and she does not like to use shampoos that are too moisturizing and she said the same thing that it made her hair look like crap i would give this shampoo zero stars if i could do not waste your money 
2013-08|1.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo| a lot of these macadamia products on the market are overpriced and full of rubbish this dried my hair out to the point where i just took it back for a refund i buy soil association organic 100 pure macadamia but oil and it works wonders for my hair right now i use tresemme shampoo and conditioner which is the best i ve come across besides joicio but i d love to find an organic or at least more natural shampoo and conditioner to use first off i m not convinced this shampoo is actually organic and secondly it dries hair out and the conditioner isn t much better has the same effect as the â 1 brands would not advise anyone to use this would never buy it again 
2013-08|4.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i love this shampoo i tried it because it was on sale bogo free at rite aid and it was a great decision this shampoo makes my dry coarse hair soft and moist when i use this shampoo all i want to do is touch my hair after i see a lot of people say that it dries their hair out but maybe because mine is already on the drier side i don t get that effect i would definitely purchase this again and recommend it to friends 
2013-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i have used so many shampoos for my hair but none of them satisfied me due to many reasons this shampoo made my hair soft healthy lightweight and shiny plus it is cruelty free and smells wonderful 
2013-08|3.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i got this shampoo when my mom accidentally bought this instead of my usual macadamia oil rejuvenating shampoo this shampoo is really hydrating but it can make my hair a bit limp if i use too much it s a standard shampoo and it doesn t do anything spectacular like my other macadamia oil shampoo 
2013-08|2.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo| i have short dry wavy color treated hair this made my hair dry manageable i gave it a good month or two but it also made it fall out more then most shampoos the only good thing is it didn t irritate my eyes or dry my scalp it wasn t worth the cost 
2012-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i absolutely love this shampoo i have very thick long curly hair i have tried every shampoo and conditioner known to man and nothing worked i saw this at my local grocery store and figured i d give it a shot at this point i had nothing to lose i fell in love after the first use most shampoos tangle my hair in the shower after i rinse it out but after just using this shampoo my hair already felt nice and silky i usually just use the conditioner right at my very ends and i ll tell you i noticed a huge different in my hair after i get out of the shower it is usually a bitch to try and brush my hair out but there are very minimal to no knots in my hair now that i use this shampoo and conditioner it is a tad bit on the pricey side for a non salon shampoo conditioner about 8 10 but it is totally worth it i have repurchased it a bunch of times and now i swear by it 
2012-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|love this very good scent like the other macadamia products lathers really well and rinses clean perfect a little goes a long way too superb 
2012-08|4.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i love this shampoo i also have the matching conditioner when my uncle came to visit he let me use his amp i loved it so much i went amp got my own it smells really good amp makes my hair really soft amp manageable 
2012-08|1.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i hate this product i ve been using this less than a week and the difference in the condition of my hair is egregious my ends are dry and hard to manage split end city in the shower my hair is literally squeaky clean but is a tangled mess a problem i never experienced with the other shampoos from this brand that i ve tried my hair feels flat and nowhere near quot ultra moisturized quot this one s going back to the store immediately 
2012-08|1.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|there is 3 different silicones in this shampoo that s ridiculous this dryed out my hair worse than any shampoo this is crap loreall evercreme nourishing shampoo is a way better choiceand is also sulfate free and silicone free
2012-08|1.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i have very thick curly hair and was looking for a more natural haircare product to bring moisture to my hair bought both the conditioner and shampoo to try at first it worked well but by the 3rd try it dried my hair out badly what is in this stuff 
2012-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i have fine hair and lots of it that damages easily it s hard to find a shampoo softens protects and doesn t cause build up my favorite shampoo used to be redken all soft but after i ran out i wanted to try something sulfate free after reading how bad it is organix and l oreal were brands recommended and easily accessible walmart target especially for a busy mom after my first few uses i love it and my hair is soft and shiny and my split ends aren t as noticeable must be something with the oils i ll report back in a few weeks if anything changes 
2012-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|love this shampoo does not dry my hair i actually find it to lather quite well for a sulfate free poo this stuff is great and paired with the conditioner my hair is moisturized shiny and my curly hair looks great plus the price isn t that bad really amazing 
2012-08|1.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|this dried my hair out terribly i used both the shampoo amp conditioner and my hair was extremely dry afterwards i used it for 2 weeks amp after switching back to my suave naturals the problem went away immediately it costs way too much for what it is amp there is not that much in there 
2012-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|i bought this shampoo based off of all the good recommendations it has received from this site as well as others i have extremely tight curls 4c that easily get dry and unmanageable i have washed my hair with it two times and each time my hair has felt great it smells wonderful it detangles my hair it makes my curls bouncy and it makes my hair very soft the consistency of the shampoo reminds me a of hair pudding and i got a very good lather for how little product i used i m very pleased and unless i find something way better when this product is finished i will buy another bottle 
2012-08|5.0|Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo|picked this up today and just used it have to say i m pleasantly surprised i bought the matching conditioner and the macadamia dry styling oil i used all three and just let my hair air dry usually i m still pretty frizzy when i air dry even especially since my coppola express is fading but my hair actually looks soft and shiny didn t weigh my hair down like most other oil shampoos like morroccan oil water aqua sodium c 14 16 olefin sulfonate cocamidopropyl betaine dimethicone sodium cocoyl isethionate cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine cocamide dea glycol distearate laureth 4 laureth 23 amodimethicone trideceth 12 cetrimonium chloride peg 23m polyquaternium 10 macadamia ternifolia nut seed oil bambusa vulgaris bamboo extract theobroma cacao cocoa seed butter cocos nucifera coconut oil persea gratissima avocado oil aloe barbadensis aloe vera leaf extract panthenol fragrance dmdm hydantoin sodium chloride citric acid fd amp c red 5 fd amp c yellow 5 fd amp c red 40 fd amp c blue 1
2020-08|2.0|Extra Strength Refreshing Scalp Tea Tree + Mint Scalp Treatment|placebo effect at best doesn t make scalp or hair oily but also doesn t really curtail itch or irritation either the scent is strong unpleasant and does not fade quickly so 8 for little to no scalp relief just to smell like a minty old hippie 
2020-08|5.0|Thick and Full Biotiin + Collagen Weightless Healing Oil Treatment|this oil treatment is now my new favorite product i purchased this product to change the texture of my dry frizzy chemically treated hair it can be used on damp or dry hair and i have done both the first time i used it on damp towel tried hair and i noticed my hair air dryed to a much smoother finish my hair immediately felt softer was easier to detangle and the silky smooth feeling lasts all day i ve also noticed that i can run my fingers through my hair with no tangles into the next day when i ve used this oil treatment on dry hair it is never greasy and a little bit can even be applied to your roots to tame fly aways it adds shine and is infused with nutrients like biotin vitamin b7 collagen and hydrolyzed wheat protein to strengthen hair this product has improved the texture of my hair and is one of my daily essentials 
2020-08|3.0|Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray|ok so the ultimate humidity test is if it can maintain curling iron waves in stick straight hair in humidity answer is no but it can maintain flat iron curls in light to moderate humidity won t buy it again but it ll maintain straight hair in a humid environment i was looking for a cheaper alternate to mlms and living proof both of which are awesome products 
2019-08|4.0|Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray|i don t like hairspray i don t like hairstyling products much period since my 30 s i decided i couldn t really rely on youth for beauty anymore and becky birdnest needed to get a hair style i don t live in a very humid place but a very temperamental one if you don t like the weather in texas wait a minute it is always unimaginably windy here and can go from glaring sunshine to pouring rain and over 100 degrees again in minuets so your hair style better be durable this is why i decided on this product i regularly use ogx shampoo and conditioner and it has completely changed my life this hairspray is in that category it made my frizzy thin wavy unruly hair behave beautifully it says it is a medium hold that is true it is also build able i would say it has a pretty stiff hold it says that it smooths frizzy hair and gives shine this is also correct it says it is long lasting maybe a little too much i use the ogx shampoo which is sulphate free for clarifying i use the bamboo volumizing one since it cleans pretty deep one wash couldn t completely remove the residue i don t want to have to go back to sulphate shampoo or strip my hair to use this product but with the style i wore i might of applied too heavily next time i will be lighter handed it did not damage my hair it did not dry it out it held up in the wind tunnel like wind of spring and the sweat of the heat i don t like the hairspray smell it has but my ysl hair mist did a good job of keeping under control for 8 in a huge can i won t be purchasing anything else this is a great spray for the price and performance 
2017-08|5.0|Shea Sleek Humidity Blocking Hairspray|i think ulta currently carries this i have not seen anywhere else i usually buy the ag frizz humidity blocker hair spray but the price for the ogx is 8 99 and sometimes they are on sale so not too bad has a really nice perfume fragrance that fades away this for me is a huge dupe for the ag frizz hair spray i live in the texas gulf coast region with high humidity and this really does its job i recommend this 
2020-08|4.0|Smoothing + Coconut Coffee Body Cream|when i saw this product at the drugstore with the combination of coffee and coconut scent i just had to try it unfortunately when i use it i can t smell any coffee although it does contain arabica coffee seed extract the initial smell is a very sweet coconut but as the day wears on i find it smells more vanilla caramel the scent does linger for hours and some people may find it too sweet for their liking so this aspect is disappointing scent aside this lotion is thick and very moisturizing and you get a very large container for a reasonable price 
2020-08|2.0|Detoxifying + Pomegranate & Ginger Scalp Toner|i was so happy to finally find a scalp treatment that didn t smell like tea tree or mint it won t replace legit dandruff products and the effect is mild but it still helps somewhat i have a dry itchy scalp and spraying this on it per the directions helps to make it feel a bit less itchy and alleviates to a small extent the dryness flaking i do have to wash my hair daily when using this especially in warm and or humid weather it can make my part look greasy and feels just kind of sticky on my scalp the scent is a very subtle fruity one and the product is easy to brush through and doesn t make hair the rest of my hair look greasy update the soothing effect after using for about two weeks become less noticeable i would still feel itchy around the edges of my hairline and my part would look waxy day of oily by the next morning discontinued use 
2020-08|5.0|Protecting + Silk Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray|i tried this after carefully studying the reviews i have tried kenra and the gvp duplicate from sally s although these latter ones have done magical in straightening my hair they both cause hair shedding this product does what it claims it is watery but it absorbs fast and creates silky and detangled strands i apply this on wet and dry hair then i apply heat my hair is to my waist and it is unruly and can get tangled easily this has been a cure 
2018-08|1.0|Protecting + Silk Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray|i bought this looking for an alternative to kenra platinum blow dry spray which is pretty dang pricey i wasn t expecting this to be the same quality but i thought it might be good enough to work as an alternative for most days not only is it not good enough i threw it away it s kind of thick and it left my hair sticky and very dry looking there was no shine like i get with the kenra kenra leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy and this does exactly the opposite my brush dragged through my hair rather than brushing through smoothly as i blow dried i also did not get any quick drying effect from it it made my hair wet and sticky and it took longer to dry it did have quite a bit of hold to it so i will give it that but overall this was really a complete fail for me and it s not like it was dirt cheap i think i paid 10 for it that would be reasonable if it was a decent product this was first purchase of an ogx product and it doesn t make me want to try any others 
2018-08|5.0|Protecting + Silk Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray|i got this at the superstore while buying my hair oil that i always use from the same brand i noticed it says on the package that it helps the hair dry faster when i blow dry it and thia sounds exciting to me as i have thick hair and takes a while to dry after washing which makes me have to wait 4 6 hours after washing it before i m able to blow dry it i tried it twice so far and love it i makes my hair look shiny and easy to straighten it also smells good i highly recommend it and would definately keep using it i also got the curly one and can t wait to try it out hope you found my review helpful if so please let me know by hitting the helpful button thanks so much for reading 
2020-08|2.0|Orchid Oil Conditioner|this was a little better than the shampoo but not by much the shampoo left my long thick hair feeling really dry and tangled this had a lot of slip in the shower and at first i thought i d like it but it simply did not make up for how harsh the shampoo is and made my hair feel really flat when it dried not a huge fan of the smell either pros good slip affordable cons don t like the smell really thin so i had to use a lot left hair flat not conditioning enough
2018-08|3.0|Orchid Oil Conditioner|has a light orchid scent this conditioner is a little heavy on the silicones and left my fine hari feeling limp did not add moisture to my hair works ok as a detangler 
2019-08|5.0|Ultra Moisture Coconut Miracle Oil Lotion|i apply this after every shower while my skin is still damp it s helped to moisturize my dry skin so much it doesn t break me out or make me feel sticky you get so much lotion for the price it smells like coconut milk with a bit of warmth from the vanilla i find it to be really nice for layering with lots of different perfumes as well to give them a creamy note 
2019-08|4.0|Ultra Moisture Coconut Miracle Oil Lotion|i have super dry crackly skin i have a hard time finding lotions without mineral oil or petrolatum and all the parabens and phthalates in them this one has some ingredients that i don t love for the most part i like this lotion i love the fragrance very tropical it starts out very moisturizing unfortunately it really does not last long my skin feels crunchy mid morning i don t have time to strip down and apply lotion every time i feel this way i do think it is a good moisturizer but not for people who have extremely dry skin 
2018-08|5.0|Ultra Moisture Coconut Miracle Oil Lotion|love the scent of this i use the hair products and body wash in miracle coconut oil i use this lotion every morning and the scent lasts a good while at night or when my skin is particularly dry i use something different usually palmer s cocoa butter because i don t find this to be very moisturizing for dry skin 
2017-08|4.0|Ultra Moisture Coconut Miracle Oil Lotion|i adore this yummy smelling super slick and moisturizing lotion i usually have to use a lotion then an oil but this actually keeps my skin dewy and hydrated for hours and hours
2019-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i said i wouldn t buy it again but that s mostly because of my tendency to not repurchase anything unless it becomes a hg product i m also looking more for uv and heat protection now that i m actually starting to heat style my hair sometimes again i haven t really even used a hair dryer very often for like 10 years so i was mostly using this on my hair as it air dried until about a month ago i haven t really looked into the ingredients to see if this actually does anything more than put a bandaid on the issue of dryness and the like but i definitely notice a difference in my hair when i use this versus when i don t and i do like it for the most part is it really doing anything for my hair beyond making it look better maybe not my guess is the silicone makes my hair look nicer at the time but that could be it however i think that this has helped prevent breakage because my hair tangles way less when i use it again probably because of the silicones making my hair smoother so i think it helps my hair a bit but i really haven t done enough research into silicone containing products to form an opinion beyond that i think more research in general is needed i have very fine totally straight hair but i also have a lot of hair and i usually keep it kind of long to around mid back give or take a couple of inches my hair gets dry very easily and can start to break and it just looks awful so i try to almost exclusively use moisturizing products the problem with that is how heavy some of those products can be which isn t great when you have hair that refuses to hold volume but this stuff as long as i don t go overboard it doesn t weigh my hair down and i notice an immediate improvement in the way my hair looks and feels i absolutely love the scent of this stuff and i think even my husband has commented on how pleasant it is it s not quite the same coconut y scent you find in some tanning products and the like but it s also not quite real coconut or coconut oil it s kind of in between a little sweeter than real coconut but not overpowering i ve also only ever used this on color treated hair and i ve never noticed any problems with my color fading faster whether it was permanent dyes or something like manic panic pros smells nice and not too strong makes my hair look and feel smoother fewer tangles easier time brushing my hair adds a little shine doesn t feel heavy weigh my hair down although it might with curls but it s hard to tell because my hair doesn t easily hold a curl anyway doesn t feel greasy or weird hasn t faded my dyed hair doesn t seem to build up in my hair washes out easily cons i think this might sometimes cause me to break out where my hair touches my face while i sleep
2018-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i have very thin hair and very dark sometimes i dye my hair in mulberry colors when my hair its dye this product not work much even so i say that take the color away but when my hair its not dye and weeks before i dye i totally buy this product again to bring nutrition and smoothness to do so

2018-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|if you like coconut fragrances you will love this aside from tbs coconut shower cream and lotion this is the closest i ve ever got to a true strong coconut fragrance as for performance my dislike of silicones aside it does a brilliant job at making my hair softer more manageable and less frizzy to the point where i can overlook the ingredients aspect of it i just use half a pump of this no more and i m good to go zero weighing down or oiliness just tangle free hair that i can brush through without breakage to avoid greasy roots i would strongly suggest to leave at least 1 2 inches above scalp when you apply to your hair some of it will naturally travel down due to gravity any way so keep that in mind only slight dislike is the pump as it s not ideal for travel end up putting into a sealable bag as it can quite easily dispense when jostled around in suitcase the pump is also prone to breaking if dropped as i have done but again no biggie for me the product works well enough for me to overlook packaging flaws at worst i can just empty into another bottle with a pump that i can pick up from most cosmetic stores for a couple of bucks selena x my hg list as i ve sampled many 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer antipodes rejoice light day cream 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment

2017-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|the best ingredients for anyone s hair should not be listed at the end of this particular product coconut oil shea butter coconut milk vit e amp egg white proteins the rest are chemical ingredients which are listed at the beginning of the product not favorable 
2016-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i love this serum it makes my hair feel soft and tames the puffiness i use it the most when i have just lightened my hair because my hair needs a lot of moisture it helps reduce the breakage that is caused by lightening it 
2016-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i wanted to like this it smells fantastic but it left a greasy film on my hair i used it for a week and it made my fine wavy hair dull and flat 
2016-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i love this stuff have been using it for several years now i have naturally curly hair which becomes frizzy without product especially in humid weather i like to wash and condition my hair apply the serum and leave to dry naturally using this product defines my curls smooths my hair without weighing it down and keeps it looking shiny and healthy and no crunchiness i don t notice the smell anymore but my hairdresser always comments on how good it smells when she is cutting my hair the only thing i don t like about this product is the bottle which has no lid every time it gets dropped on our bathroom floor the cap breaks and the pump is then useless i always keep an empty bottle to decant the serum into in case of breakage but a plastic cap would fix this issue as the product costs about 18 in the supermarket here in australia better packaging would be great but i will keep on purchasing regardless because it does such a great job 
2016-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i received this product in a shampoo conditioner combo pack at sam s club first off it smells amazing like a real coconut oil smell not a weird perfume y overly sweet fake coconut tanning oil smell i only put a little bit in my hair after washing because i typically have trouble with oils weighing down my fine curly hair it felt great and smoothed my curls i just went to lather up my 3 day old hair in this stuff to do a little deep conditioning and put about 3 4 pumps a lot in my hand and started to run it through my hair i have hair above my shoulders and after a second of trying to coat all of my hair it didn t even look like i put oil in my hair i don t know if that s a sign of how dry my hair is or what but this is not the heavy serum like many of these reviews are saying i would say it s medium lightly greasy in comparison to ones i ve used in the past i didn t even feel the need to wash my hands afterward as for anti breakage claim i m not sure everyone s hair is so different only complaint it didn t come with a lid and you aren t able to twist to close so it s a bare pump asking to ruin something while traveling 
2015-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|for me does nothing for the frizz the only thing it does is pull the curl out of my hair i guess because of the weight it actually makes my hair look worse due to this smells amazing though definitely will not repurchase 
2015-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i hate this stuff it literally just feels like a film of residue oil over your hair i m a hairdresser and i d highly reccommend you to switch over to any other oil if it s affordable for you moroccan oil works so well with overprocesssed hair i have tons of split ends from going black to blonde to purple and i swear by it 
2015-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i got this because it claimed to reduce breakage but it just made me look a mess i have fine long wavy hair and this serum made it look like i poured oil on my head and just left it there i couldn t style it and it just hung in limp chunks i only put one pump in so i m not sure how much less i could have used i think the smell was lovely but i could tell in my hands it was sticky and thick and probably not a fit for my fine hair i imagine people with more robust hair would have a better experience 
2015-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|it s kinda meh i used this with the other products i use for damp hair and i apply this exclusively to my ends i don t use a lot of it since it covers a lot of hair and it makes my ends super soft afterwards however after five minutes my hair feels just about the same as it did before my ends are still soft but they look dull the formula is also super thick so it might be better suited for people with really dry hair mine is normal i ve tried to incorporate this into my hair routine but it doesn t do anything for my hair no matter how yummy and tropical it sounds won t repurchase
2015-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|ok if you read my other reviews you will see that my husband and i went to harmon face values over the weekend he purchased the large organix coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and the coconut milk spray i love this serum i only used it a few times but here is why i like it it smells good it is not sticky i have tried other anti breakage serums and they can be sticky like a lip gloss or have an odd chemical smell this smell great and is great to use as instructed on towel dry hair or even on dry hair i will say this a little goes a long way i have long thick wavy hair and i only use a dime sized amount for all of my hair i think it works well with other organix products and harmon has the best price for it only 5 99 is the everyday low price for 4 oz it adds shine and is great to use in those in between days when you have not washed your hair in a day or so i also love the packaging it is great so only a small amount can be dispensed at a time which is great when you are using a serum with oil i used it last night in my dry hair and brushed my hair with a paddle brush i really love it i would definitely give it a try 
2015-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum| this serum is very thick heavy and gummy and sticky feeling like putting castor oil in the hair i m sort of impressed because it is hard for me to actually find products that are quot enough quot for my hair and this serum was way too much for me i have very thick very long straight hair i tried many ways to using this first i tried just the ends and it left my hair feeling like a ball and chain it was so heavy oily and stuck together mind you i did only use a little bit i did the mistake of applying it mid shaft and down and my hair was so gross afterwards sticky heavy weighed down and greasy i once tried this as a pre shampoo treatment just to get rid of it huge mistake it took three washes with shampoo and i eventually resorted to dish washing soap to get it all out i cannot imagine people with fine hair using this after my amazon forest of hair can t tolerate this i do like the smell but that s not enough for me to keep using this or buy it again 
2015-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|overall i dont know if i see any improvements to repurchase if you put too much your hair will feel greasy and a bit heavy after you dry your hair make sure to put it in your hair when its still pretty damp to dilute the serum or else it s too heavy and just feels thick the coconut smell is way too overpowering im not a huge fan of that type of smell but it does go away after a bit
2015-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|this is my fav serum my hair is super fine and prone to breakage and this makes it feel so soft and healthy you only need a little btk of this stuff using too much can seriously weigh down your hair 
2015-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i wish that the more recent reviews were there when i was researching this because i probably wouldn t have purchased it i have naturally wavy curly hair that i have been wearing au natural no drying or ironing and though i have dry sensitized ends i have an oily scalp which requires daily shampooing so i really needed something to help soften up the ends this didn t do anything except make my hair look greasy i used it numerous times and my hair looked bad each time it leaves a sticky gummy residue that is difficult to wash out smells nice though the fragrance doesn t last 
2015-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|cant believe that so many people like this it not only did nothing to my hair but made it just sticky and coated with oil maybe cuz i have thin hair i dnk but it was truly useless way too thick of consistency i never usually throw out products i always use them up cuz i hate wasting money but i had to make exception and throw this out 
2015-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i usually only review things i love but i am making an exception for this serum i can t believe how highly reviewed this is because it was just awful on my hair i have long virgin hair and use serums daily after showering this serum is thick and tacky doesn t absorb and leaves hair greasy i have tried it on my hair dry and wet and either way it is awful it either does nothing or leaves my hair stringy and greasy the renpure moroccan oil serum is the best drugstore serum i have found it actually seems to absorb into the hair leaves it soft and shiny 
2015-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i read a few reviews and thought i might add that you should use this on your hair just after you have washed it while it is still wet i tried this years ago also and found it to make my hair feel greasy filmy oily yucky but i tried it on dry hair one day about a year ago after the shower i tried it because i have extremely long hair and sometimes brushing it is just not fun and wow now i just love it so so much i have tried much higher end stuff and yes those are nice too but this is so wonderful for the price and smells so nice i can brush my hair it doesn t add grease and grime it just dries wonderfully soft and silky and unknotted all day so if you have this and just disregard it try it on wet hair and concentrate on dry damaged areas not your roots i don t think you ll be disappointed it also much better than the argan oil one in the little gold bottle as i figured i d try that one too in my opinion that is d 
2015-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i had tried this several years ago when my hair was dry and damaged and did not care for it flash forward to now and i find it in my cabinet and decide to give it another go unfortunately the results were pretty much the same i only put a little on my ends but it didn t really make much of a difference besides making them a bit oily not that that s such a bad thing when it comes to your ends but if it s just kind of sitting on your hair and not actually doing anything productive it kind of defeats the purpose so while i can t say that this works for my hair it does make a great divine smelling moisturizer for dry hands and that s what i ve been using it for i m glad it s not going to waste 
2015-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i m not sure that it prevents breakage but it leaves my hair so soft my hair doesn t tangle as much and doesn t feel as brittle plus the smell is amazing this is an essential part of my hair care regime 
2015-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum| this serum is just way to thick for me also its just loaded with silicones and although silicones are handy for sealing in moisture it was like this serum sucked all the moisture out of my already dry wavy hair it did make my hair a little bit shiny but i like more natural serums or at least serums with less heavy silicones it does smell really great though but i gave it to my boyfriend who used it to smooth down his beard which it worked well for 
2015-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i use this together with the shampoo amp conditioner from the same line first of all it smells gorgeous the consistency is slightly on the thicker side and i don t need much to get a good result i put it in my towel dry hair before blow drying it and it smoothes out my hair without weighing it down good stuff 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i love love love this serum i have definitely seen many improvements in my hair my hair has less breakage now and my hair used to stay one length because of breakage and this is the only thing i found to help my hair not break it smells like coconut which i really like half a pump goes a long way so i know it ll last a long time my hair has grown an inch which makes me happy it cost about 5 dollars and some cents i m definitely buying this again 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|most amazing thing i have ever put into my hair and i have mixed girl hair definately have seen many improvements amp 9786 amp 65039 
2014-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|omg i don t know how to describe this its a very warm scent like really warm warm and coconutty omg its so good anyway i have noticed the amount of hair coming out of my hair has lessened overall a very good product for a nice smelling product that has actually helped both nourish my hair but i would not recommend it to those who like me have fine hair as it weighs it down quite a lot
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|love it i used it at night doused my hair in it and left in over night smells fabulous also 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i seriously don t know if this product has stopped my breakage because i do other things to my hair as well but im sure its helping cause since i added this to my regimen my hair feels and looks so much better 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i love this product i have extremely long hair and only have 2 3 haircuts per year it is a miracle for my ends my hair is prone to tangling because it is so long and this helps with that and makes my hair super soft it also smells lovely important tip do not use this products at the roots because it will probably make hair greasy up there only use at least 2 inches away from the roots on the rest of hair i will probably be using this product for forever 
2014-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|first off i can t even do justice to the smell of this product it smells like someone bottled a hawaiian beach pretty much scent heaven but onto the rest of the product i honestly thought this was just ok the first time i used this product march of last year it worked amazingly and i mean my hair was silky shiny smooth with literally no frizz which is basically a miracle in itself for my hair i continued to use it almost every day for about 8 months bottle 2 by the way this stuff lasts forever and then for some reason i stopped using it for about a month when i started using it again it affected my hair in a completely different way it didn t do anything to harm my hair it just wasn t really doing anything to help it well at least that i could feel maybe it was just because it had made my hair so healthy that this product couldn t do anything to make it feel even better i m not sure but i ve definitely been using it a lot less lately don t get me wrong this is a really good product at first but using it for a few months might just make it average feeling i would repurchase this item after a while of not using it maybe a year but that would mainly be to test it and see of it had the same effects as the first time i used it 
2014-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|too greasy for my thin hair and did not help with breakage smells good though 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|hg product i absolutely adore this hair serum it smells like a sweet pina colada literally good enough to eat comes in a clean fresh modern packaging nice and simple with a pump action lid this serum gave my hair a lovely sheen and tamed any fly away strands i even put a tiny amount through my hair after it s been styled so i get the scent 10 10 would recommend to anyone that is looking for a good all round oil maybe not for anyone with severe problems who want a definite solution i e dryness severe split ends over bleached etc 
2014-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|this product was not for me i feel as if i wasted my money it didnt help my hair at all but maybe it was already too far gone who knows 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|hg my hair has no slip whatsoever especially in summer and i was so frustrated by it this adds slip shine and hydration sooo happy and it smells delicious i want to try the coconut water one too 
2014-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|am i missing something i thought this was just ok i have a few other hair oil products and another organix serum and often i feel my hair is soft for a hot minute and then gets drier as time goes on and i m not a daily washer i bought this from recommendations on here but i won t buy it again it smells nice but i find the keratin one was a little better granted my hair is damaged but still it doesn t do anything special i returned it biosilk is still my favorite despite what people say about the alcohols in it i find the silks in there do improve hair softness and frizz 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|so i have been dyeing my hair for many years heat straightening etc last year in may i decided to blonde i used color oop s to strip the dark dye out of my hair did this 3x over 3wks oh yes hair torture lol after 3months of being blonde even with deep conditioning etc i had the worst damage ever so i got a good trim amp went back to my natural dark brown hair color so here i am a year later april still heat straightening my 3b curls only dyeing my roots to cover the grays and even with trims i have noticed my hair just breaks and won t get any longer i immediately stopped straightening got a good trim and started embracing my 3b curls and introducing my hair to this serum and omg am i glad i did i started using this in april and here we are in june i can totally see a difference with my hair bigtime the scent is just insanely yummy and this feels so lightweight on my hair zero greasiness obviously i apply to my ends and work up halfway of my hair length breakage is pretty much all gone and my curls look sooooo much better while using this 1 pump is all i need simply amazing stuff 100 repurchase over amp over 
2014-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|this serum is great for the price i haven t been using this product for a couple months since i switched to an argan oil hair treatment but this smells amazing i just run it through my ends with damp hair and blowdry or airdry it s not as expensive as some other hair treatments and a little really does go a long way however i don t think i ll be repurchasing this after i m finished because i prefer the argan oil one i have which is a lot more expensive mind you 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i am absolutely in love with this the smell the price the consistency and the results in the u s this retails for around 5 8 depending on the store and sales going on i picked this up because i have had pretty good experiences with the organix line before i was previously using joico kpak styling oil and noticed is was making me breakout all around my scalp hairline cheeks neck anywhere my hair touched the ingredients in this seem simple and it is effective i apply two pumps to damp hair and let it air dry can also be used on dry hair working through the ends a great deal on a product that will make your hair smooth and silky and also smell delicious hopefully not pica inducing 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|love this stuff made my hair so soft and shiny after just a few uses smells awesome my hair is super long amp fine and i have been dying my hair since i was 14 my hair is very long almost to my boo tay and i only need to use 1 pump using too much will make you greasy 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i love this product before this product i had bought the morrocan oil treatment and the its a 10 miracle leave in products which were really expensive and they suck compared to this this oil makes your hair supppper soft and shiney i love my hair after putting this on but the only negative side would be that it doest make your hair greasy if you put too much execpt for that it is great 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i am in love with this serum after countess dyes bleaching and heat torture sessions my hair was on the verge of death it would fall and the breakage was so noticeable with all the visible fly always and broken hairs all over my bathroom floor don t even get me started in the straw like dryness and the frizz it was awful my hair wouldn t hold any style it was so pathetic luckily during a visit to my local target i came across this little number when i read the description i couldn t believe it so i sampled it i know it s bad but i had to see for myself i tested it on a problematic area in my hair and oh boy was i amazed the hair soaked it up like a parched person in the sahara desert the smell was divine there was absolutely no left over residue or greasiness my hair looked so shiny and transformed it actually made its way back to my natural wave after i purchased i ve used it everyday since it makes brushing so much more easier i don t feel my hair breaking after i apply this product it s a good protectant against heat as well i used it on dry hair damp and to tame flyaways throughout the day i would recommend this product to anyway in a hair crisis it s fantastic 
2013-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i thought this serum was just ok it was no miracle worker on my hair but it didn t have particularly negative effects on it i have frizzy hair that s oily at the roots but very dry brittle ends and typically use tresemme nourishing rituals cashmere touch hydrating serum on my ends after washing my hair or biosilk silk therapy which is on the pricier side i tried this coconut milk anti breakage serum when i ran out of both after reading lots of glowing reviews on it but i feel like i had to dispense more product from this bottle than i did from the tresemme serum to get similar results i had a similar issue with the organix renewing moroccan argan oil penetrating oil i tried a long time ago which i also had to use a ridiculous amount to feel like it had any effect my hair is not very long just past the shoulders and it s not very thick the coconut milk serum didn t weigh my hair down at all even after applying as much as i did so i take it it absorbed well into damp hair but i don t feel at all that a little goes a long way with this and i guess now i can admit that i personally don t seem to like the smell of coconut in general and of course this smells strongly of it will be switching back to my tresemme serums which feel just as lightweight absorbent and hydrating using far less product than this organix serum organix just isn t impressing me 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i bought this after reading a lot of good reviews on it i have used moroccan oil light and the oil from ag both of them didn t seem to properly absorb into my fine hair now i may have fine hair but i do have a lot of it so after reading reviews on this since being on the hunt for a new serum i went out and got it i found it at our local superstore it was like 10 i think normally i wouldn t be too keen on using a non salon product but i decided to try it all i can say about the results are amazing my hair feels hydrated and less crunchy i flat iron my hair everyday and it is also colored every 8 weeks or so my hair also finally looks shiny and healthy and it is soooo soft in fact i just got a compliment on how great my hair looks like an hour ago i never have gotten compliments on my hair before it absorbed really easily into my ends and mid shaft that s where my hair is the driest and i didn t notice any stickiness i let my hair air dry and it just feels incredible the smell of it is also fantastic but if you don t like coconuts then i wouldn t recommend this product it has quite a strong coconut smell but the scent doesn t linger which is nice so if you can put up with the scent for a little while best serum ever i also really like the packaging for it love how you can lock the pump so its convenient for travel i haven t noticed any leakage or anything so far but that might just be because it stays on my bathroom counter the price was also fantastic i am so not made out of money so i m really happy to have found something that works and is reasonably priced i will definitely be buying this again once i run out overall excellent product really made a difference in the appearance feel and overall health of my hair definitely recommended 
2013-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i use this any time i decide to go blonde and will be facing straw like hair as a result the product smooths and hydrates the hair and tames frizzies and it smells delicious a little goes a very long way first warm it by rubbing between your hands and then apply it to the bottom half of wet hair if you re worried about the product being too heavy for you there s a lighter version in a spritzer bottle as well hope this helps 
2013-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i had the maraccon oil before this but i ran out so i wanted to give this a try i had mixed feelings when i put it into my towel dried hair but it really made a difference my hair useto feel really dry and gross but this has helped to make it softer and more alive i would definitely look into this if you re hair is dry 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|one of my hg hair serums smells amazing doesn t leave my ends greasy but keeps them super healthy and strong definitely lives up to its name and the smell oh my goodness i love the way this stuff smells when i put it on my boyfriend won t leave me alone i put in on towel dried hair that s been combed out with a wide tooth comb two pumps warmed between my hands and worked onto the bottom half of my hair 
2013-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i really like this product i have very fine dirty blonde hair with blonde highlights and this serum makes my hair look very healthy without weighing it down after shampooing just shampoo with no conditioner i add a small amount of this serum to my hair more on the ends and blow dry it leaves my hair very soft and frizz free all day it also smells amazing of pure coconut and is very clean feeling not sticky and leaves no heavy residue 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|i love love love this stuff it really is like hair crack to me now i am in my third year of college and i have been dying my hair since the 3rd grade i am not even joking so my hair has had some rough time grant it i didn t dye it all the time but straightening it a lot sure didn t help my hair however i stopped dying my hair last year and have been attempting to grow out my natural hair and it has been a slow and steady process i actually don t really have much split end but my tip area little on the dry side which does not look cute when i let my hair air dry so in an attempt to rebuild my hair i bought this serum and it truly does work my hairs feel sooooo smooth and soft now i love touching it after it air dries and my tips no longer look dry or frizzy its great i usually just use one pump for my whole hair and it seems to be working just fine it doesn t make my hair oily its not heavy and it smells amazing too i honestly feel it has helped my hair growth and i could not be happier i do warn though i have been using their keratin shampoo and conditioner so it is kind of like a triple threat and that may have some influence either way love this stuff 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|wish they had bigger bottles lol its great smells good and really helps after you straighten hair i use it after i shampoo and conditon and after straightening keeps my ends healthy and shiny
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|loooooove this stuff it really works after using it my hair is so moisturized and smooth and overall a lot healthier i can t stop touching my hair after using this 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|this is definitely my new hg serum i have tried every brand i can think of and i kept going back to john frieda but tried this one based on reviews here i am blown away this stuff made my hair so shiny and soft and i was even able to blow dry it out i never am able to do that because my hair frizzes this stuff is unreal one note using less is more lol i used the same amount i usually do with others and it was too much oily 
2013-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum| __reviewtextreadmorev2__ data enableyoutubepreview true data productid 104370 data reviewid 2559024 data text i have very dry fine blonde hair damaged as a result of 10 years of highlights and hardcore bleaching i am on a mission to find that one product that will put the moisture back into my hair so i decided to try this out this product definitely made my hair look better it felt silky and less begging for mercy parched as it usually does unfortunately the irony of it is that it really is not meant for fine hair the only way i can describe its consistency is as if you put glue on your hair causing the oils and whatever else is in there to sit on top of the hair follicle instead of being absorbed by it sometimes causing clumping i tried using a smaller amount and distributing it more sparsely but my hair still ended up looking greasy and weighed down within a couple of hours it really is a shame update i continued using this applying only a tiny amount onto towel dryed hair and almost a year later i think it has really improved the look of my split ends and the texture of my hair i have very dry fine blonde hair damaged as a result of 10 years of highlights and hardcore bleaching i am on a mission to find that one product that will put the moisture back into my hair so div
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|for the price of this serum this is the best serum i have ever tried i don t even need to use conditioner because this serum is so great i used to have very dry brittle hair and thanks to this serum my hair is incredibly soft and shiny it also protects my hair from heat styling this serum smells so delicious i will definitely be repurchasing this again 
2013-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|not impressed at all i put this in my towel dried hair and it still was just as frizzy when it dried without anything in it it s going back to cvs gotta remember to buy real coconut oil that stuff really works plus i can cook with it 
2013-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum|it was soo oily and sticky in my hair and it did nothing at all it comes in a spray though and that works amazingly the oil is terrible but the spray is great 
2019-08|4.0|Coconut Water Weighless Hydration Oil|packaging transparent bottle presents with a splash of coconut water which illustrates well of what is the contain of this hair oil it comes with spray nozzle which sadly it does not function that well as i need to press hard like the nozzle gets stuck somewhere and it does not spray evenly like fine mist to spray out the hair oil onto my palm a coin size of oil not fine mist price quite pricey but i do not mind buying because i really cannot resist myself from ogx hair products especially hair oil serum i bought it online qoo10 quite sometime ago which again sadly the seller usa seller no longer exists oil texture hey do not freak out just because it is oil ogx claims that it is weighless which is very true and once i spray out the oil onto my palm and start to warm it by rubbing my palms together it dries up very quickly so no fear that it might overweight your hair to make it looks like oil slick it is something very light and hydrating enough you do not have to worry of over using it if you have hair texture like me dry straw and frizzy hair scent lovely coconut scent it smell so sweet with warm coconut scent anyone who likes coconut by products will surely falls for this hair oil it is not overpowering if you are wearing perfume on your body clothes but just itself alone can work out well like a hair perfume verdict an overall good performed hair oil with coconut oil coconut water and electrolytes which in my opinion it can use alone by itself if you do not use with its matching shampoo and conditioner i personally need 5 6 sprays of oil for my middle length hair which is very dry and untamed the oil dries up very fast and it means all the coconut goodness can soak up perfectly into the hair cuticles rather than just sitting on it electrolytes is a key ingredient which recharge and hydrate your hair but this oil is not strong enough to prove sufficient moisture and hydration to my hair it does create a bit of healthy shine but my hair is still dry with frizz and tangles abit on my hair although nothing too amazing as i fantasize so much of hair product commercial kinda mirror shiny hair this hair oil might not be a hit for someone who really needs moisturizing hair oil for very dry hair because i myself mix using this hair oil with my other types of hair oi the body shop olive nourishing dry oil sephora all in one nourishing oil followed by this ogx coconut water weighless hydration oil and a bit of mineral oil to block the moisture from humid weather to enter into my hair cuticles and reactivate the crazy frizziness if you are a huge ogx fans like me you may give this product a try 
2019-08|4.0|Coconut Water Conditioner|packaging in a typical ogx plump transparent plastic bottle no leakage from its flip flop bottle and the bottle is made of a tough plastic material no dented when fall on floor clean and simple packaging with nothing gimmick or flowery price quite expensive but worth buying or giving it a try when there is a sale conditioner texture average thick creamy texture it does not flow out from its bottle which is something good as i hate runny conditioner as it gives me an impression that it is not moist enough for my dry and frizzy hair it is easy to spread through my hair middle length downwards to hair end and not too rich and thick that sometimes it is a bit too slippery that it might fall onto the floor before it gets spreaded evenly on your hair be precise of your quantity and not to over squeeze extra as this is an average conditioner not too thick but not too watery which i do not need to use that much for my middle length hair scent lovely sweet coconut scent something sweeter than its matching shampoo with a hint of tropical fruit punch and buttery vanilla scent a great scent of conditioner that makes you feel like you are on a tropical island beach during your summer holiday no joke it smells that great and you definitely enjoy you bathing time with this lovely bottle in your bathroom nothing too overpowering which makes you feel uncomfortable the scent lingers on my hair the next day despite the attack of different horrible smells from motorcycles and other vehicles polluted air and eateries verdict after using its matching shampoo i pair it with this conditioner it is a bit hard to squeeze out from the bottle due to its creamy texture it works out well to detangle my hair and i let it sits on my hair for about 10 15 minutes before i rinse it off with warm water followed by cold water to seal the hair follicles cuticles it smells so great but hydrating level is not on the top although not ultra hydrating as ogx stresses that this conditioner is ultra lightweight even though it is made of coconut oil coconut water and electrolytes as my hair still gets frizzy after drying and flat ironing i would recommend this product to those who have fine limp hair and need a bit of hydration which is not too rich and creamy as it might overweight their hair worth giving it a try if you have not and especially if you like product that smells so yummilicious like ogx 
2019-08|4.0|OGX Coconut Water Shampoo|packaging a transparent plump bottle just a typical ogx shampoo packaging with a flip flop cap cap closes tight and no leakage the plastic material is quite tough not those cheap fragile plastic that can easily get dented if falls on the floor not very eye catching compared to other ogx ranges because of its transparent bottle price quite pricey as compared to other brands but worth buying if it is on sale shampoo texture transparent liquid with a runny texture be careful of pouring out the shampoo and you might get too much of the quantity that you need scent a sweet lovely tropical coconut smell with a hint of buttery vanilla touch nothing too overpowering that will give you a headache it makes you enjoy your shampooing time with this product just like other ogx hair products it smells delicious enough to eat and no doubt close your eyes you can imagine you are on a beach with ample sunshine and a touch of sea breeze enjoying a coconut drink to quench your thirst ie time for your dry and stressed tress to get some nourishment from the goodness of coconut verdict i bought this product quite some time ago i dug it out again to use it before it gets expired which was such a waste i love ogx products despite they are quite expensive but having a few bottles of ogx shampoos and conditioners are just too mentally comforting quot especially for me who is a product junk and i just can t say no to ogx products the shampoo is made with the main ingredients of coconut water coconut oil and electrolytes which work out as a good combination to nourish dry straw hair to silky smooth and tamed tress they are good ingredients to recharge your hair which might be dry like straw and an extra touch to keep it presentable and easy to comb through and most importantly to make it smell nice unfortunately this is not really what happened to me as ogx stresses that it is ultra lightweight hydrating in other words the shampoo is a bit weak to overcome my dry frizzy hair problem even though i use it in combination with its matching conditioner and hydration oil hair spray the shampoo itself works well as it creates so much foam and thoroughly cleanse my hair with a lot hair products 3 or 4 types of oil and or serums to tame my dry frizzy hair so you can imagine how dry and unruly my hair is nothing too overburdening of this shampoo as ogx precisely describes that this shampoo is ultra lightweight perhaps those who have fine limp and tame hair but needs a bit of nourishment and hydration can give this product a try 
2019-08|5.0|Anti-Gravity + Hydration O2 Conditioner|one of my favorite ogx conditioners whenever i use this my oily scalp and roots seem to be more balanced over the following days there s no heaviness or weighing down if anything it makes my hair feel clean and refreshed my hair looks shinier tangles are much less frizz is to a degree reduced and this is despite me only using it for 3 minutes which for some reason is the magic number for me there s quite a few reviews online where people are not getting good results with this and for them my tip would be if they still have the bottle to use it for a shorter amount of time and see whether that works better as i think for some the whole oxygenating effect is too much if left on long not noticing the promised volumizing effect but that may be because my hair type is not the fine hair that this conditioner is targeted at i have thick hair with oily roots and struggle to find a conditioner that doesn t leave me more oily will definitely re purchase selena x my hg list as i ve sampled 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment
2019-08|4.0|O2 Shampoo|i literally have a cabinet full of ogx hair products as i m making my way through trying out as many as i can this one isn t particularly new but i just hadn t noticed it before on my thick oily hair it cleans very thoroughly almost squeaky clean yet without stripping my hair the downside to that is the tangles i end up having to use a ton of conditioner to rectify it on the plus side it smells amazing like i ve had a good salon treatment and my hair actually feels hydrated and has more bounce to it volume i m not so sure about as i haven t noticed any difference in that department but overall i m happy for me this is not quite as effective as the charcoal detox shampoo and conditioner but so far it s a close second selena x my hg list as i ve sampled 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment
2017-08|4.0|O2 Shampoo|my husband who has shoulder length hair and i both like this our hair is color treated and wavy it s difficult to comb out because it tangles easily mine is very fine and his is very thick the formula while this isn t clear from the packaging and description is for people who need both moisture and volume i have traditionally found most volumizing products to be very drying which this isn t it smells wonderful and isn t overly floral like some of the other ogx products he is extremely particular about scents especially with hair products because so many are coconut my only complaint and i have this issue with most ogx products is that when they get low it is difficult to get the last of the product out of the bottom because the bottles are pretty rigid and the lids and shoulders of the bottles are rounded so you can t do the quot stand it on its top quot trick unless you have something to lean it on on the upside they have actually made the shampoo and conditioner different from each other in this line the shampoo is in a transparent bottle and the conditioner is opaque so unlike some of the others i can easily tell them apart in the shower when i don t have my glasses on 
2016-08|2.0|O2 Shampoo|oh boy this was drying on my hair too bad because this smells absolutely amazing like high end perfume i was surprised at the perfume like scent since it doesn t seem to coincide with the quot airy fresh quot concept but it s lovely 
2016-08|4.0|O2 Shampoo|i love this shampoo but like all haircare products you will only like this if it is right for your hair type this shampoo is perfect for people with fine hair that need very little moisturisation and that is easily weighed down although this is a quot hydrating quot shampoo i didn t find it particularly hydrating at all if you have fine dry hair you would be better alternating a volumising shampoo with a moisturizing shampoo than use this edit originally loved this but found it was making my scalp very itchy which isn t surprising as it is very highly fragranced

2019-08|4.0|Healing + Vitamin E Conditioner|this is the conditioner that lead me to the shampoo and not the other way round i leave it on for about 5 minutes sometimes even applying a tiny amount as a leave in conditioner and then rinse i love the fact that it has a ton of vitamin e in it and leaves my hair smelling lovely for the rest of the day a fruity fragrance keeps my thick hair looking shiny more manageable and less knotted without making the roots oily i didn t find the shampoo to be as good as the conditioner and will definitely try pairing it with some of the other newer ogx shampoos and see how it works with them vitamin e is a great antioxidant to protect hair and it s good to know i m actually doing something worthwhile for my hair when using this there s not many conditioners i can say that about selena x my hg list as i ve sampled 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment
2019-08|4.0|Healing + Vitamin E Shampoo|another week and another round of ogx goodies to try out first in line was the vitamin e shampoo i actually started out with the conditioner loved it and went back to the store for the matching shampoo it s very gentle and helps tame the perpetual friziness that s the bane of my life rinses out easily lathers well but leaves my hair not quite as squeaky clean as i d like it to and over the next 2 days after washing it does get slightly oily probably best suited to drier and finer hair types mine is more on the oily and coarse side one thing i must mention is the smell it s an amber pepper fragrance that i m still not too sure whether i like or not it s unusual for sure not a bad shampoo by any means but also not quite what i was expecting it to be the only reason i ve given it 4 lippies instead of 3 is because it contains a very generous amount of vitamin e in it higher up on the ingredients list than any other shampoo i ve seen before although i m not convinced vit e is any better for conditioning hair than say panthenol vit b5 it s still an excellent antioxidant and the perfect antidote for free radicals which if you live in an urban or high uv environment like i do you ll likely be exposed to on a daily basis this is the kind of shampoo that works long after you ve rinsed it out and for that reason it s a keeper selena x my hg list as i ve sampled 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment
2019-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i don t get the good reviews after using it i had to check the label to make sure it was a conditioner at all cause it feels like applying shampoo on your hair even lighter than most shampoos actually doesn t moisturize smooth or detangle my hair was a mess of knots it s not even cheap damn it and the packaging is awful looks pretty but it s a pain to get the product out 
2017-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i enjoy the scent of this line it smells like cocoa butter this conditioner is a really thick formula rinsing this out my hair felt moisturized but not silky like with other thick formulas it did condition well and detangle my hair together this shampoo and conditioner did help my frizzy hair much more than other smoothing formulas ever have i also noticed a lot less hair fall out in my shower and my hair looked healthier with continued use will i purchase again i am not too sure if i do it will only be the large bottles and only if i can find them on sale i felt the shape of the bottle really made it hard to squeeze out the very thick formula 
2017-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i like this i have dry damaged hair and this helps it and it smells good 9 and i get the bonus size so not bad price i wouldn t use it every time i wash my hair though as i have a feeling i still need more moisture but it s a nice conditioner for using on occasion 
2017-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i liked this better than the shampoo but still nothing special conditioner felt moisturizing and smooth but after my hair dried it made no difference i dislike these containers hard to get all the product out
2017-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i am super impressed and a bit amazed by this conditioner my hair is fine a bit damaged from constant color changes and wavy frizzy if i let it airdry but easily straightened with a blowout iron my hg conditioner of all time used to be the old pre 2013 redken all soft with avocado oil cannot use the newer formula with argan very drying i have been on a mission for years to find a replacement and decided to try this because it contains avocado oil and it had some solid reviews online i never buy drugstore products but was intrigued especially for the price i have to say this is seriously a very close 2nd place to the old redken all soft in fact the closest thing i have found in years and i buy try return a lot of hair products it s one of those conditioners that as soon as you put it in your hair you can instantly run your fingers through effortlessly and the smell is delicious afterwards my hair is super shiny doesn t feel coated looks very healthy manageable and doesn t frizz when airdried i use this with the enjoy luxury shampoo sulfate free and gentle afterwards i use the ag hair moisture conditioning mist detangling spray 1 pump of redken heat glide mixed with 1 pump of paul mitchell skinny serum and blow out with a sportnette italian round boar bristle brush will definitely try more products from company soon 
2016-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i have very dry frizz prone damaged looking hair it is also quite thin so i was looking for a product that would help condition my hair and help cope with bad hair days unfortunately this only seemed to work for me in the initial few applications after which it did nothing for my hair it smells good but that s not what conditioners are meant for left my hair feeling rather dry and dull could be just the way my hair is and might need more work overall would not re purchase once i m through with my current supply rather disappointing 
2015-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|this has always been one of my favorite drugstore conditioners works well to moisturize my hair and leave it smooth and soft smells very good too can t beat the price and this is my go to at cvs when i m on a budget 
2015-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|love this the shampoo is ridiculously thick you only need the tiniest bit and mix it with water my scalp is oily and prone to itchy painful bumps which have totally gone since i have been using this shampoo and conditioner alternating with the anti breakage keratin oil products from ogx as well my hair is damaged baby fine and very porous normally i need at least twice as much conditioner as i do shampoo not the case with this stuff if you can imagine it s more like a body butter than a body lotion you re getting the idea of how thick and creamy it is i really didn t think this was going to be great with my hair meanwhile i use about half a teaspoon of the conditioner and it is more than enough to massage through from my ears down to the tips i never do my roots because it s so thick it stays on your hands which gives more control of application i m not crazy about the smell it s sweet and nutty almost chocolatey i m sure lots of people would love that though the end result is hair that is surprisingly full soft and silky i m hooked 
2015-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i actually love this conditioner as it always leaves my hair feeling softer moisturized and more manageable it is very thick due to the silicone content and cocoa butter my hair loves silicone additionally this actually has more keratin than a lot of the higher end brands i ve bought from my hair feels healthy after using this although i do not believe it permanently undoes damage because it doesn t repair broken bonds in hair only olaplex can do that but nevertheless on a regular basis this conditioner is in my top 5 for conditioning masques my only gripe is that fragrance is so high up in the ingredient list deionized water behentrimonium chloride cetyl alcohol glycol stearate glycerin dimethicone cetearyl alcohol ceteareth 20 parfum hydrolyzed keratin protein theobroma cacao extract cocoa butter cocos nucifera oil coconut persea gratissima oil avocado aloe vera aloe barbadensis extract aloe leaf panthenol tetrasodium edta dmdm hydantoin methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone blue 1 lake ci 42090 red 40 yellow 5 tip you can actually buy a cvs knock off for a few bucks cheaper i reviewed this one a while back because the organix was out of stock looked up ingredients online on my cell while in store to compare here is the cvs keratin straightening conditioner ingredients water aqua behentrimonium chloride cetyl alcohol glycol stearate glycerin dimethicone cetearyl alcohol ceteareth 20 fragrance parfum hydrolyzed keratin theobroma cacao cocoa seed butter cocos nucifera coconut oil persea gratissima avocado oil aloe barbadensis leaf extract panthenol tetrasodium edta dmdm hydantoin methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone blue 1 ci 42090 red 40 ci 16035 yellow 5 ci 19140

2014-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i have longer than shoulder lengh naturally dark brown hair thick and is wavy but tamable it has been highlighted and lowlighted for the past 6 years whenever i get bored so i need moisture for my hair the first time i used this product it did not do anything regarding straightening abilities and did not smooth it out i used it a few more times and alternated conditioners and this one left the least amount of moisture none if anything i know it is sulfate free but i use aveda leave in which is also sulfate free and it does an amazing job leaving my hair smooth i was looking for an alternative leave in as the aformentioned one costs 120 500ml i decided to write a review because yesterday after i used the organix product it left my hair knotty unmanagable rough and i used 3 pumps of moroccan oil and it still felt rough my hair was clumping and i was scared to wash it today despite that i used an old bottle of l oreal mask which i know has a lot of sulfates and it feels amazing at this moment this conditioner smells amazing but does nothing for moisture or straightening my hair i would get the same result if i did not use the conditioner i know it is not because it is sulfate free because the aveda one does wonders but crazy expensive i will keep on looking 
2014-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|this product is straight down the middle of average for me i absolutely adored the scent and the texture of the conditioner was nice and creamy but i didn t find it was anything close to a quot therapy quot for my hair it did the job of a conditioner but didn t stand out as any better than cheapie palmolive or tresseme types for the price which i paid aud 20 there are much better conditioners out there matrix s hyrdatherapie range costs about the same and moisturises my hair triple the amount that the keratin therapy conditioner did give it a go if you re looking for a basic conditioner that will give your hair a gorgeous smell but don t expect any miracles 
2013-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i don t really understand why this conditioner doesn t have better reviews it s affordable smells divine free from nasties and leaves my thick long dry hair detangled and silky soft i also use it on my dogs and it makes them very soft and shiny too

2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|this is one of my favorite conditioners it smells amazing it s super thick and rich and it helps soften shine my hair my hair is super straight already though so i don t know how well it works to manage curls waves as with almost any shampoo conditioner i am not buying it right now it seems my hair gets quot used quot to it by the time the bottle runs out it s back to frizzy and not as shiny and i have to switch to another brand for a month or two fairly affordable it s 5 8 depending on where you can find it packaging is adorable i love the fact that this brand is sulfate free 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i ve been using this product every other week for about 2 months now i ve seen significant improvement in the thickness of my hair after loosing 4 inches of hair to heat damage i ve tried to find a way to infuse protein into my hair on a regular basis i didn t really notice how thick my hair had got until after the 3 4th use but nevertheless the product lived up to it s claims i give it a 4 5 because my hair is not soft after using this conditioner and also because alcohol is listed as an ingredient i use this product mainly for the hydrolyzed keratin protein and nothing more if you re relaxed and trying to get your hair to a healthier state i recommend giving this conditioner a try 
2013-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|smells good seemed very promising but i was highly disappointed this product made my hair very dry and knotty i had a hard time brushing my hair after using this although the price is very reasonable it is still not worth this product 
2013-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i have been through every hair product on the market over the years and came across this one day in cvs i had a coupon and figured why not my hair is fairly long and naturally curly wavy and prone to frizz nothing really works on it except john frieda s line i didn t have many high hopes for this but it only cost me 99 cents with the coupon first time i used it my hair was very sleek and tame it was very noticeable it was easy to style and handle but not straight not sure why it says straight because it did not make it straight it simply relaxed it a bit i am giving it 5 stars because it seriously knocked me off my feet how good my hair is now i switched back to my redken the other day and it made it frizzy i wanted to check how much this organix was working and kept switching back and forth every time i went to the other brands it became frizzy or harder to manage i went and bought the shampoo and conditioner for this now and the heavy duty repair conditioner i love this stuff that much 
2013-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|this shampoo and conditioner combo is just not doing it for me i have thick wavy color treated hair that i flat iron a few days a week without straightening my hair is a crazy mess this stuff is good if you straighten every time you wash but if you let your hair air dry you might find it tough to get a comb through the results are just very inconsistent i took this stuff on vacation to an air with hard water and it reacted very badly i literally could not brush my hair i suspect the conditioner works best with the entire line of products from this group plus careful heat styling but on days i don t feel like heat styling i shouldn t be left with near dredlocks days that i do heat style carefully the results are not any more amazing than i get from suave john frieda or paul mitchell smoothing straightening lines 
2013-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|best shampoo and conditioner ever i noticed a differ ec the first time i used it couldn t recommend it enough
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|this product is better than ok but not amazing i like it because it detangles my hair and makes it softer i was looking for hair care products that would keep my thermal reconditioned hair straight but the product didnt do its job 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i love this conditioner my hair is soft and shiny and this stuff smells so delicious like chocolate but it s a nice light scent it has lasted a lot longer than the same size bottle of shampoo because you need so little its thick and creamy but doesn t leave my scalp greasy the bottle is small it s a little pricey for what you get but like i said you don t need to use a lot so it lasts a long time 
2013-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|smells amazing like chocolate coconut this makes my hair feel silky and it does straighten it a bit 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|hg shampoo and conditoner for me i have long color treated curly wavy hair it is fine but there is alot of it my hair needs lots of moisture for it to look its best and this stuff takes the cake i love how it smells and i love how smooth and silky my hair is afterwards i usually don t see much if any difference after using different shampoos and conditioners but with this line my hair is noticebly soft my s o even commented on the difference in my hair when i first started using this over the summer i wash and condition my hair 2 3 times a week sometimes i can get away a whole week 
2012-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i love this product it has become my favorite conditioner ever i have super curly mixed hair and it works wonders i find it makes my curls looser and more manageable and the scent is great i have gone through so many of these bottles because unfortunately they are not very big and i use a lot of conditioner they should look into increasing the size but besides that i give this 2 thumbs up 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|worst conditioner it smells great the bottle is nice but i can not comb the knots out of my hair immediately after use so it s no good 
2012-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i actually really liked this i ve got semi thick damaged and dry hair it was very moisturizing had a great smell it didn t make my hair any straighter so i guess it didn t live up to the quot ever straight quot claims overall it s a pretty good conditioner 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|just used it today after using the coconut shampoo used quite a bit because shampoo left my hair feeling tangled the smell was weird and it didn t quite make my hair silky soft like my dove one does the price is ridiculous for how much you get 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i wanted to love this conditioner after hearing reviews from my friends and watching a couple of videos however for some reason my hair became dry after using this conditioner i tried different amounts as well but nothing seemed to work loved the smell though

2012-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|this is one of those products that sounds like it is going to be fantastic then falls a little flat i really looked forward to some smoothing benefits from the bkt conditioner but i have gotten much better results from cheaper shampoos the smell is nice and light and the packaging is pretty but the conditioner is painfully average if you are looking for deep nourishing conditioner try aussie or pantene 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i bought this conditioner thinking it would be perfect for my chemically treated hair i had just gotten a keratin treatment does organix know that brazilian straightening and keratin treatments are very different i don t think so the most important thing to me in a conditioner is that is does just that conditions my hair was dry and brittle after using this just once i usually love organix products but this formula with good intentions is a total miss skip it 
2012-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i switched to sulfate free shampoo and conditioner awhile ago because i used to dye my hair a lot and it helped keep my color from fading i had read a lot of places that sulfate free products are much better for your hair too this was the second sulfate free brand i ve tried and the second bottle of organix conditioner i ve used i want to love this product but i just don t it smells amazing like coconuts but does nothing else for my hair it doesn t moisturize it at all to the point where i don t even really see the point of conditioning if this is what i m going to use i have almost waist length wavy semi colored and highlighted hair and it s ended up frizzy over time i m thinking that part of the problem is this conditioner even with only washing every other day and using a leave in conditioner and argan oil my hair is still super dry i m definitely moving on from this brand once i use up my bottle 
2012-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|love love love this line of organix i use everthing from the serums to conditioners paraben and sulfate free i have tried everything under the sun to no avail from the super exspensive to the inexspensive i have very thick coarse dry hair and this product has helped immensely i recomend the whole line great price with great results worth a try cost ranges from 5 00 and up nothing over 11 00 and most always on sale 
2012-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i rarely purchase a product more than once but this is one of them i use the shampoo conditioner and the leave in oil i love this line it smells a bit coconutty but it doesnt linger very long and is light and not overpowering my hair is smooth and silky and it tames the ends i do have a bit of natural wave but not much the product smooths out the waves for a straighter look i dont blow dry or style my hair its really long right now i usually just air dry it it feels nice on a summer afternoon to have wet hair love the packaging its super cute reminds me of asian cosmetics short and bubbly i have bought this a few times now and will continue i am really lucky i have nice hair to begin with and dont really put too much time into it or spend too much money 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|didn t like the shampoo nor this conditioner of the same line it felt like i was adding lotion to my hair which didn t do a thing for me it left my hair ultra frizzy and so unmanageable i tried blowdrying it straight but my hair was out of control i have thick coarse hair and this made it worse i threw out the conditioner rip 
2012-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i bought this product because i was short on cash and desperately needed something with protein to help with my highlight damaged hair thanks to l oreal frost amp design usually i use tigi dumb blonde reconstructor it s definitely not the same but after a few uses i decided to purchase the matching shampoo too the conditioner has an odd texture because of the glycerin in it i also end up using a dab of suave after i rinse the organix out because it doesn t detangle my naturally curly hair as much as i prefer what i like is that some of my curl pattern is returning and it s better than using nothing what i don t like is that i must use mousse or gel when air drying or else i get a frizzy mess something that doesn t happen with tigi still it smells good and since i can buy both shampoo and conditioner for less than what i d pay for the dumb blonde alone i ll stick with this until i finish the bottle btw the bottle is ridiculously hard to deal with after a few uses i ll have to remove the top in order to get the rest of the conditioner out 
2012-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i gave this product overall rating of only 3 i would still recommend it but first of all i don t like packaging of it after first use it is very hard to get product out of the bottle it looks cute but it s very unpractical for getting the conditioner out it annoys me to shake and try to squeeze bottle in the shower for 3 minutes to get it out and i only used just about quarter of the bottle it is rather small bottle as well i don t think you get many uses out of it however price is not that bad so if it works well for your hair it might be worth it once i got it out of the bottle the product is really thick great smelling and makes my hair soft it does take some frizz away it didn t straighten my hair they are frizzy curls i didn t expect it to straighten my hair but it did help me to manage them a little bit more in the shower my hair feels really soft and it s quite easy to comb through them with my fingers which i have to do in the shower however it is not moisturizing enough for me once my hair dry they are not as soft anymore i think first and second use i got great results after that my hair went back to what it was i am not sure if it s because of silicons in it i try to use silicon free conditioners however i used hair masque that does contain silicons so i am open to try most of the products all in all i think this can work wonders for someone with wavy dry but not extra dry and damages hair i like shampoo of this brand more see review because it doesn t contain sulfates which is hard for me to find but when it comes to conditioner i prefer something more conditioning for my hair type really dry ends from about ears down quite a lot of frizz i would recommend for someone with not as damaged and dry hair for me i am not sure if i would repurchase this but i would definitely buy shampoo again 
2012-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|this is a okay conditioner but i never believe theres a shampoo or conditioner that will actually straighten your hair it only make the hair less frizzy but it made my hair more managable the only two things that i frown upon is the bottle is almost impossible to squeeze the stuff out and its a little expensive 6 97 but other than that it made my hair smell nice and made it softer i might repurchase this again 
2012-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|having bought this on impulse mostly because of the way it smelled i was very happy with the results my hair is very fine gets greasy easily is colored and is also falling out but that s irrelevant this conditioner made my hair soft and smooth and considering that after shampooing with any product my hair feels like straw this was a very good result the results seem to be quite long lasting also my hair looks and feels a lot smoother very shiny and silky i m not sure if this is because it contains ingredients supposed to repair hair or whether it is just a thick conditioner i do prefer another conditioner in this range the macadamia oil one but this keratin conditioner is one of the best i have tried in a long time 
2012-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|as much as i want the organix line of paraben and sulfate free shampoos and conditioners to work for me nothing has really impressed me so far this conditioner didn t really do anything special for my hair i have thick very wavy curly hair i didn t see much difference with frizz and my hair didn t feel extra soft like some other reviewers experienced i could have gone without it and my hair would look and feel the same way i really loved the way it smelled but i don t think this is the best conditioner for me 
2012-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|this line of products is paraben and sulfate free which is a plus because sulfates strip your hair from its natural oils they are color safe as well i love the coconut fragance of the shampoo and conditioner its subtle and lingers in your hair all day very pleasant but the reason i m raving about them is because after 2 washes my hair felt so super soft and the mouth opening moment came about 2 hrs later i let my hair air dry and it looked like i had blown it it was straight and frizz free and with lots of volume after i wash my hair i always add organic argan oil to my ends but i did not have this experience with my dozens of prior shampoos and conditioners i had used beore i love it and because of the results on my hair i will be needing less heating tools and products to style my hair i purchased mine at my local bj s they have the 25 4oz bottles for 9 95 try it ladies specially if you have wavy frizzy hair 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|tried it this morning and it made my hair frizzy and dry this conditioner didn t provide any slip or moisture to my thick wavy hair i would not repurchase nor recommend to anyone with my type of hair 
2011-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i have both the shampoo and conditioner in this line and purchased them for 6 each due to mispricing of the product but i heard from the cashier that they normally retail for 10 each i bought this by recommendation of michele1218 on youtube as i was in the market for an affordable but high quality haircare line the reasons why i was interested in organix hair products are because they are 1 sulfate free 2 paraben free 3 cruelty free and 4 pact full of good ingredients such as coconut oil keratin protein avocado oil and cocoa butter another important note to make is the beautifully rich brazilian nut fragrance i am obsessed with this scent and also happen to have a body scrub by the tree hut that smells just like these hair products i feel like my hair is so well nourished by the shampoo and conditioner that i only need to use them twice a week as a treatment i normally wash my hair 3 times a week which means that i will use them every other wash all in all i love the shampoo and conditioner and would recommend that you give this a try if you re in the market for luxurious feeling cruelty free hair products without harsh chemicals and don t cost an arm and a leg 
2011-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|this conditioner retails for around 18 in australia i got it for 15 on sale at coles for the price it s an average conditioner although i m sure there are better conditioners at the drug store level which are much better the only exceptional thing about this conditioner is that it smells delicious when you apply it onto your hair you don t feel that soft and luxurious soft hair feeling that a higher end conditioner will give you although the packaging is cute and the smell is breath taking the name is a bit misleading as it s not a fully organic product instead of a conditioner i ve started using it as a bathing body milk and it makes my skin smell and feel nice i might even purchase the shampoo and use it as a body wash 
2011-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i love love love this conditioner i have dark wavy and thick hair that is dry and frizzy on the top layer due to uv exposure and styling damage this conditioner is better than frederick fekkai paul mitchell bed head biolage and biosilk all of which i use in my hair rotation it smells a lot like cocoa butter and the smell lingers but i love that smell so it s okay it s the richest most luxurious conditioner i have come across and i have spent hundreds on conditioners i truly recommend this and i will purchase until it isn t sold any longer love 
2011-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i use this conditioner and the the shampoo to wash my coppola keratin treated hair whenever i find it on sale i stock up as the bottles are small and i run out quickly and that s why i m only giving 4 stars overall the smell is very nice almost chocolatey i also like the keratin oil that they sell and add it to the conditioner i ve been using this product for at least a year and will continue to do so 
2011-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i had to add this to pville because it seems that everyone is reviewing this one under the straighening product or the treatment this is the conditioner sold in a 13oz bottle i am on the fence so far on this one it does not seem to be as conditioning as i would have expected from the ingredients and it was a little sticky on the first use which was better on the 2nd use after shaking it very well to mix it up 
2019-08|5.0|Flexible + Beeswax Texture Hair Spray Wax|i ve become a hair product junkie all of a sudden i wear my hair in a pixie and i love the piecy tousled look i have tons of products sprays pomades dry shampoos beach sprays you name it i have it i have several ogx prods and this is one of them it s great usually after i dye my hair or give it a repair treatment it gets slippery soft and does not hold a style i spray this and gently mess my hair voilà i have soft shiny piecy hair i also have redken s wax spray which i like but i think this is better because it s not so hard and it definitely gives a nice shine if you have fine thin hair like mine less is more but the golden rule remains the same with any kind of hair don t overdo it 
2018-08|5.0|Flexible + Beeswax Texture Hair Spray Wax|i ve really been liking various ogx hair care products and this flexible beeswax texture hair spray wax is great imo i have a variety of quot texture quot sprays that contain wax and i do like them ag dry wax joico texture boost sexy hair play dirty ion texture spray wax and they all do a fine job but this ogx beeswax is just perfect and i ll be purchasing this again it s a wonderful finishing spray that gives hair a nice piecey look and definitely smooths fly aways and reduces or even eliminates frizz it gives my hair body and makes it more sleek and polished looking without appearing oily at all you definitely don t want to over spray and you do need to spray this lightly from at least 10 inches away super easy and quick to use and does everything i need to maintain a nice polished piecey look my hair is shoulder length or just below shoulders and is a bit course can get frizzy when i blow dry it and this product just quot fixes quot everything 
2019-08|3.0|Liquid Pearl Conditioner|probably my least favorite from all the ogx products i ve been trying recently used this straight after the shampoo and left in for around 5 minutes roughly the same amount of time as other conditioners i tried to get a good comparison there s no shimmer or glitter in this one and as far as drug store conditioners go it s ok but not really worth the cost there are much better ones out there left my hair shinier and slightly softer but not good for tangles in the shower and i also found my hair was becoming both frizzier and oilier whilst using this better suited to drier hair types the scent lingers pretty much all day too so definitely pick this up and have a sniff as it s not the kind of fragrance that everyone will take well to sea salt kelp beach y smell selena x my hg list as i ve sampled 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment
2019-08|3.0|Liquid Pearl Shampoo|after trying the charcoal shampoo and conditioner early last week i went straight onto the liquid pearl ones another fairly new offering from ogx firstly the shampoo i liked it but it performed nowhere near as well as the charcoal shampoo did which i feel is much more suited to oily hair types and if you have build up the liquid pearl shampoo had a slightly unusual smell i can t put my finger on what exactly but is a joy visually iridescent pink with a pearly shimmer throughout it also lathers surprisingly well the only place it falls slightly short is on my hair texture whenever i use this my hair feels pretty dry even though there s no sulfates in here some other ingredient they ve used does not work for me i ve read the same thing in other reviews online too about it drying out hair for reference i did follow with the conditioner but still found the results to be mediocre at best not a bad shampoo by any means but not one that i d be rushing out to repurchase in a hurry selena x my hg list as i ve sampled 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment
2019-08|5.0|Purifying Charcoal Detox Shampoo|for the past 2 weeks i ve been on an ogx shampoo amp conditioner spree so many new ones out with excellent reviews online that i just had to try first up was the purifying charcoal detox shampoo this one caught my attention as i m a big fan of briogeo s charcoal shampoo but it is pricey and would be great if i could find a cheaper alternative so first impressions i m impressed the scent in here is slightly on the masculine side but don t let that put you off for a sulfate free shampoo this cleanses really well and lathers decently too it could be the combination of charcoal and kaolin clay but there s much less build up than normal and my scalp actually feels much calmer and isn t flaking nor itchy which is fantastic have tried out some of the other ogx shampoos which i ll review seperately but none compared to this for overall results on hair and scalp will definitely be repurchasing this selena x my hg list as i ve sampled 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer lush enzymion 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment
2019-08|1.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner| i have fine wavy hair prone to frizz in humidity i use pureology hydrate amp palmers coconut oil shampoo and thought this would be worth a try as it claims to hydrate hair though this shampoo and matching conditioner claim to be sulphate free there is another chemical present which left a strange coating that actually flattened straightened my hair out fortunately superdrug always reliably good service refunded me my 12 for this and the conditioner not many stores would if you have fine hair avoid at all costs
2017-08|5.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|this works perfectly for me i have quite fine hair but lots of it so actually conditioners for thick hair can be too heavy this conditioner leaves my hair silky but still feeling very clean this is not the conditioner for you if you need any kind of repair or treatment it s a good all purpose every day conditioner that won t weigh your hair down i haven t tried the matching shampoo but don t think i need to i strongly recommend this for normal hair days if there is such a thing 
2016-08|1.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|this product did nothing for me no slip no moisture no difference i didn t notice anything special while in the shower and i didn t notice anything when i got out 
2016-08|3.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|my change out winter only conditioner can leave my hair oily over moisturized looking if you get really dry winter hair try this but rotate with sea mineral 
2016-08|5.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|best of the range for frizz great heavy conditioner i have highlighted long hair and this conditioner beats salon brands for me for fine hair it may be too heavy but wow after the first use my hair had movement and shine must try the serum
2015-08|5.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|this conditioner is perfect for my course often times frizzy thick processed hair super thick and smells like the hawaii i can see how this intense conditioner may be too heavy duty for people without thick coarse dry hair like mine but for me and others with the same hair issues this product is tops 
2015-08|5.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|i love this conditioner i have very thick dry and dull hair and been trying to find some shampoo that helps me get it to look like a real person s hair so i decided to give a try to the organix products since i read very good reviews of it s coconut line i went to the nearest drugstore and started checking all the organix lines in order to choose the one that suited my hair type the better so i decided to go for the kukui conditioner as it says hydrates and defrizz my life long battle with friizz is coming to and end and combine it with the awapuhi ginger shampoo this one is for repair hair i decided to combine both lines for a fuller range of benefits and it s awesome i ve been using them for over a month and the change in my hair is undeniable it s shinier and smoother the only thing i don t like that much about this conditioner is the smell i prefer frutier and freshers scents instead of the nutty ones 
2015-08|1.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|i keep trying so that i can use up the bottle but it s just not good the worst of the organix conditioners imo i have thin stranded but dense color treated hair this leaves it dried out and impossible to even run my fingers through when wet feels like it just sits on hair and never penetrates it also doesn t help frizz as claimed 
2015-08|4.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|love this conditioner leaves my skin very smooth and glossy definitely my favourite from the organix line have tried all of them i was not impressed with the rest of them 
2015-08|5.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|i love this conditioner i have tried several products from the organix line and this is my favourite one yet i have already repurchased it twice and will probably continue to do so i have not tried the shampoo version yet but i have used it in combination with different organix and live clean products the bottle is sleek and black and the smell is not the best i ve tried but still good i have wavy blonde hair it is currently shoulder length but i have used this when i had very long hair as well and this has always done a good job of conditioning it this leaves my hair soft and shiny and very healthy looking it does not weigh my hair down at all i find a lot of products either leave my hair poofy looking or too limp but this does a good job of keeping it a little more defined and lively looking i was surprised to see the bad reviews i know no product can work for everyone but my experience with this product has been excellent would recommend to people with similar hair types 
2015-08|5.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|i have re bought this product twice now i absolutely love how good it makes my hair smell it reminds me of a kind of hawaiin fruity nutty smell comparing it to other conditioners i ve used so far this is definitely the best one yet it isn t as heavy as others that i have used on my hair but still makes my hair feel more conditioned than any other ones i have used the bottle shape is cute but is quite annoying as there will still be so much in there yet you have to squeeze the wide sides as the shape is a bit impractical the brand organix always goes on sale too which is a plus i don t think i ve even bought it for it s original price yet by the time i have to get another one i ll probably jinx myself on that one now though i do have to say this may not be the best conditioner for hair that goes oily quickly 
2015-08|1.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|this shampoo conditioner combination is one of the worst i ve tried it turned my otherwise reasonably healthy hair into straw kukui oil on its own is so wonderful but this formulation is awful my hair s overall condition improved once i stopped using the combination 
2015-08|1.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|i have medium thick wavy hair and can usually skip washing every 1 2 days not with this i had to wash every day because this left an oily residue on my roots i m constantly trying new conditioners and have never had this problem not even with other organix ones i ve recently switched to a beekind conditioner sample from my birchbox and the problem went away also the smell is really overpowering and too sweet for me 
2014-08|1.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|i think i have pretty much used every organix shampoo and conditioner and it s safe to say that i will never be buying any of their products again i have used the coconut kuikui and the brazilian blow out first use no problem second use omg i thought i was going to have to chop off my hair no matter what conditioner i applied my hair was so rough and tangled it happened with each and every one of them i figured maybe my hair didn t like coconut i figured let me try a different one big mistake samething happened i wanted to like it because everyone raves about this company i just don t think it s worth damaging my hair by the way my hair is wavy curly frizzy 2c 3a hair type i rather stick with my sulfate shampoo after all they keep my hair healthy 
2014-08|4.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner| edit not sure if this conditioner has been reformulated since i wrote my review but the conditioner in the newly repackaged skinnier bottle has an added vanilla scent so it s like a vanilla nut smell vs the scent of the product that came in the flatter pancake shaped bottle which was kind of floral nutty this conditioner makes my hair sooooo glossy it s ridiculous the scent is amazing but i m not sure how to describe it it smells fresh and delicious but not super perfumey or overpowering it s thick in texture but not super heavy it turns thin once it touches your hair if your hair gets super dry you may need a more emollient conditioner whether or not i let my hair air dry or blow it out straight or use a diffuser to add waves my hair always comes out glossy like i drizzled clear lip gloss over each strand and i know it s just this conditioner and not due to the matching kukui oil shampoo since i don t always use it with its matching shampoo and my hair still comes out glossy i wish it came in a larger size and a different bottle the almost pancake like shape of the bottle can be kind of clumsy otherwise it s a great sulfate free cruelty free drugstore product that i ll definitely buy again 
2014-08|3.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|this isn t the worst organix conditioner but it s not as amazing as it looked after a year of using the coconut milk one i wanted to try something different this hasn t dried out my hair like a few of the others but it doesn t make it silky soft or detangle like the coconut milk conditioner does it smells good but the scent fades away quickly it s just not for my hair but could work for others 
2014-08|3.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|this conditioner was just so so for me i have fine coily kinky 3c 4a type hair for reference i loved the smell and the thick creamy consistency and it did make my hair soft but i got the same results as i do with aussie 3 minute miracle i didn t even finish the bottle because i noticed more breakage and shedding than usual after the third use it s a shame i really wanted to like this line of products the price is right and they have great ingredients 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|i love this the best conditioner from organix this is the only product that has a long lasting wonderfull smell to the second day it made my course shair shiny after the first use i felt my hair was stronger and thicker the formula is creamy so it lathers perfectly it actually even did help with my hair frizzing will definetely buy again 
2013-08|4.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|i picked this up from walgreens along with the sea minerals conditioner from organix it has a finesse like smell if you have ever tried that before it is a strong scent too kukui oil is actually pretty high on the ingredient list and it has a couple of cones which my hair doesn t mind i just make sure to clarify every now and then it gave decent slip but not as much as the sea minerals conditioner it does hydrate and soften well and keeps frizz down my hair looks shiny and it didn t pull out my curls this is working out for me in the winter time slightly better than the sea minerals conditioner due to the fact that it doesn t contain as much glycerin if you enjoy using organix products and have had luck with many of the products in general then you will like this 
2013-08|5.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|so i tried this organix new conditioner and i have to say compared to another organix one i was using i love it i was about to give up on organix and find another organic brand of conditioner because these keep my forehead from breaking out but they were just okay for my hair and my hair was starting to dry out and just look thick and dull one use of this on the ends of my hair and the sea mineral shampoo on my scalp and the next morning my hair was shiny and soft love it the smell is fine just a general clean smell which isn t bad but not as yummy as the others i will update this after i finish the bottle to see if there is any residue or long term affects but for right now my hg conditioner i also reviewed the sea mineral shampoo 
2019-08|1.0|Organix Hydrate+Defrizz Kukui Oil Shampoo|i have fine wavy hair prone to frizz in humidity i use pureology hydrate and palmers coconut oil thought this would be worth a try as it claims to hydrate hair though this shampoo and matching conditioner claim to be sulphate free there is another chemical present which left a strange coating that actually flattened straightened my hair out fortunately superdrug always reliably good service refunded me my 12 for this and the conditioner not may stores would best suited for someone with thick coarse hair if you have fine hair avoid at all costs 
2018-08|1.0|Organix Hydrate+Defrizz Kukui Oil Shampoo| __reviewtextreadmorev2__ data enableyoutubepreview true data productid 168469 data reviewid 3020093 data text i would definitely not repurchase this shampoo and would not recommend it to anyone unless you have extremely without exaggeration dry and crusty roots scalp otherwise you will end up like i did with oily sticky sweaty and disgusting looking roots right on day 1 after washing your hair with this but you would still be left with your frizzy and damaged lengths this is a product just for parched desert dry roots and it did nothing for my poor lengths and i used it alone without any hydrating masks conditions which i never apply to my roots anyway but in combination with then things are a total disaster when i saw the claims hydrate defrizz this sounded exactly like what my hair needs because it is very long with dry tangled and frizzy lengths and ends but my roots are normal to dry ogx shampoos are also generally free from nasty ingredients and for 7 this seemed like a great bargain but no i would definitely not repurchase this shampoo and would not recommend it to anyone unless you have extremely without exaggeration dry and crusty roots scalp otherwise you will end up like i div

2018-08|1.0|Organix Hydrate+Defrizz Kukui Oil Shampoo|the australian market versions of ogx are like washing your hair in in dish detergent the conditioners are just as bad 
2016-08|3.0|Organix Hydrate+Defrizz Kukui Oil Shampoo|these shampoos are not for color or heat treated hair most of ogx s shampoo contain sodium olefin 16 14 which lathers a lot and also opens the cuticle opening the cuticle on fragile hair makes it always worse as this leads to splitting and breakage those brillo pads spots that s breakage fyi it s fine stuff for a teenager with oily skin and virgin hair it s trouble if you use dye bleach or heat 
2016-08|5.0|Organix Hydrate+Defrizz Kukui Oil Shampoo|my hair is thick and down to my upper thigh and dry latin hair and i looooooove this shampoo my hair felt like it was straw like the others said but only while washing i have been having a hard time with oily roots and shampoo s not cleaning right so i loved the squeeky clean feel for once i did not use a conditioner when i dried my hair it was sooooo soft and glossy exactly what i have been going for i am going to buy the conditioner and see what happens but i do love this shampoo 
2013-08|5.0|Organix Hydrate+Defrizz Kukui Oil Shampoo|o m g i found this tonight and wow i am a huge fan of organix and my hg shampoo and conditioner and deep mask is from their cocoa butter line this one is my runner up this controlled my curls and waves like crazy and made it super soft this is a little different than my hg one in that is defines my curls more instead of relaxes them mega shine and total control over frizz and dryness great shampoo great conditioner and i tried the other products in the line too all are a great product highly recommend 
2019-08|4.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Sugar High Tousle Spray|well obviously one person s food is another s poison this spray is ideal for me i have baby fine thin hair cut in a short pixie i adore the textured piecey look but i have a whale of a time trying to make my hair behave the way i want it to i have a closet full of sprays waxes creams pomades you name it i have it texturizing sprays leave my hair dull and stiff ditto sea sprays waxes and creams weigh my hair down not too keen on foams because i my cut does not look good with elaborate blow drys and then i found this spray i thought why not well it works super well for me first of all it is not a finishing spray too wet for that i use it on dry hair and then i tousle it while it s still wet it dries very fast and since it s not too heavy for me anyway i get the piecy look i like so much without my hair looking dirty or greasy or heavy the thing is not to overdo it start with a very light all over spray then go on adding according to your taste again don t overdo it i hope this helps a bit 
2018-08|1.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Sugar High Tousle Spray|not impressed ogx my hair is thick and a little wavy and all i wanted was some texture but this stuff made my hair so greasy the exact opposite of what i was looking for and this is weird but its such a wet product i got little to no texture at all from this stuff where it got to the point where i drenched my precious hair in it and still nothing there goes 9 dollars i ll never see again what a waste of money smells good though but that is it upset u ogx
2018-08|1.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Sugar High Tousle Spray|this stuff does the opposite of what it says i was looking for a replacement for the garnier and nuance versions that the stores around me stopped carrying those gave me volume and texture and seemed to absorb a bit of oil this spray instead comes out very wet it instantly makes hair go limp i used it twice after curling my hair and both times it ruined the curl it is more like a shine spray but too heavy and wet to even recommend for that this brand always suckers me in with the scents and packaging but i think i m giving up on it

2018-08|1.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|the australian market versions of ogx are like washing your hair in in dish detergent the conditioners are just as bad 
2017-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|this shampoo really works for my dry hair my hair are colored and i ve been looking for a sulfate free shampoo that doesn t break the bank it makes my hair feel so light clean shiny and bouncy also love the coconuty smell that is not overwhelming at all i ll repurchase it for sure and looking forward to try other shampoos from ogx i use it everyday xx 
2017-08|1.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i don t like this shampoo at all my hair is long straight and normal usually the most cheapest shampoo works the best on my hair but this one made it very dry and after just one day it was dirty i won t buy this product again 
2017-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i bought this once at the time i was going through a quot coconut quot phase lol it smells amazing and fresh it has great foaming texture feels clean and the bottle looks nice i would definitely buy it again but the prices for this brand are pricey not bad but most of them have great scents guess i can t complain 
2016-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i m so happy i found this shampoo it s a lot more difficult to find products for oily hair than for dry hair but this seems to do the trick my hair tends to be on the oily side i had been washing it every other day with the oiliness starting to show about a day and a half in when i wash my hair and use the matching conditioner on the bottom half only it looks good after two days and with a little dry shampoo i can easily stretch my washing to every third day it lathers very well which is surprising to me since there aren t any sulfates the scent is very similar to coconut water the conditioner smells nice but doesn t smell quite the same 
2016-08|4.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|this smells really really good it is tropical and fresh it does not dry my hair out but using this i either have to use dry shampoo or wash my hair every day i think it makes my hair soft and shiny though the packaging is really nice too and it definitely is unique my hair is not very damaged so i don t know how well it would work for someone who has hair that is very dry tangled etc also i do think it is a little pricey for a drugstore level product overall because of the scent and the way my hair feels after using it i will probably keep buying this if i could go without washing my hair every day it would be perfect 
2016-08|1.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i know it s supposed to be organic and free of all the usual irritants but this shampoo makes my scalp itchy and flaky i usually don t have dandruff and my skin is is pretty hardy and rarely reacts to anything i ve used it three times now and i haven t changed anything else with my hair routine it cleans well but the itching is driving me insane i wash my hair every 3 days and the itching starts on day 2 so perhaps it s ok if you wash your hair every day but honestly i don t think i will even finish the bottle 
2016-08|3.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i got this because i saw it thought it would be a great shampoo i ve always loved the organix brand a lot of their products are awesome this one though does not do a good job cleaning my hair it leaves residue on my scalp it makes my scalp itch etc it does smell good but it is not that great it might be just that my hair doesn t absorb it that well but it s no good to me 
2016-08|4.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|this is the first time i have tried the ogx brand and because of the coconut water i decided to give it a try i love the cute bottle and even more so that it is made from recycled resins i think the smell is great not too strong and it cleaned my fine hair very well and left it lightweight the texture seemed a little thick but when added to the water it was fine here is a video review https www youtube com watch v myebrtclgga
2016-08|4.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|so recently i noticed my hair was getting super dry my hair is super important to me so i obviously went on the hunt to find something to help when i came across this shampoo i was hoping for the best but not really expecting to get it omg i was so wrong after one use i could already feel my hair being more hydrated like the product claims now it s been 3 uses and the results are very great i d say my hair is back on track to what it used to be you really can t beat the price either 
2016-08|4.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i bought this shampoo as a set with the matching conditioner and a tangle teaser while i was in hospital and desperate for some kind of soap shampoo body wash that didn t smell like chlorhexidine surgical scrub the stuff the hospital supplies it was pretty pricey 33nzd for 2 travel sized products and a full size tangle teezer lets face it i probably paid for that brush more than the shampoo i was excited to try it because holy smokes it smells like heaven after i bought it i came here to see what other people thought about it bit of a backwards risky move reading reviews after purchase but then again i m not well known for doing things in the normal order i was really worried that i d just spent a bunch of money on a dud product since most people here with similar hair types to mine think the best and only good thing about these products are how they smell and that they did nothing for their hair i was pleasantly surprised my expectations were lower than atlantis firstly the shampoo has a really interesting kinda jelly like texture that lathers really nicely and gives a good clean it smells like my trip to samoa tropical and coconutty almost juicy if i could eat this stuff safely i probably would i initially tried it by itself since my hair is so fine if i walk in any kind of humid air it turns into a flat greasy mess and let it air dry it was shiny and soft but almost a little dry so i followed it up with the conditioner the next day wow i almost never use conditioner in my hair since it makes it greasy and limp but this combination of them both was fantastic i have soft shiny bouncy tropical smelling hair and a tangle teezer booyah long story short pros smells amazing cleans hair without leaving it feeling squeaky fun jelly like texture and lathers nicely doesn t leave my hair feeling weighed down like many shampoos cons was a bit pricey but i m pretty sure that the tangle teezer brush in the set was the real expense doesn t seem to be all that hydrating on it s own needed the conditioner afterwards i m going to have to buy the full size of both products because they re lovely to use i live in nz where everything is 700 more expensive 
2016-08|1.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i don t care for this shampoo as it makes my hair really dry for reference i have long blonde highlighted hair i don t recommend this shampoo to anyone 
2016-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|loving this i have fine greasy hair ew this leaves is shiny and soft and gently smells like piña colada minus the rum i m not overly crazy about the scent of coconut and like that this is not sickly sweet while it leaves my hair looking and feeling lovely i have to say that static is a bit of an issue i am zapping everything i touch including the dog she doesn t seem to mind so we re lucky hoping that as the weather warms up and my house is less dry then this resolves itself 
2015-08|3.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|pros this shampoo cleans my hair well it has a thicker consistency almost like hair gel and i found it fun to massage it into my hair the smell is coconut y but not too strong which is good cons can be difficult to get shampoo out of the bottle due to the consistency and the bottle shape means you cannot stand it on its head i used it with the corresponding conditioner and unfortunately my hair was full of static after i used it so i would not recommend it to anybody with fine hair living in a dry climate like i am 
2015-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|this is a good shampoo that cleans hair thoroughly and leaves it feeling good i have fine hair but lots of it and between straight and wavy hair 
2015-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|the cons first sometimes the bottle isn t filled all the way and the cap breaks the pros very high lather faint scent good cleansing power excellent for keeping hair soft if you prefer a gentle clarifier this works some shampoo like the very clarifying but sometimes too potent aussie volume creates tangles but this one doesn t interfere with my curls in fact after trying it tonight i think it s a keeper i m the cheapest person with shampoo but this one is worth the extra few dollars it removes product without destroying your hair and the clear gel type formula is great for those who dislike heavy creamy shampoo 
2015-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i ve been using this for a few months now and i think that this gave my hair life again my hair used to be all dry and brittle as well as the top of my hair i decided to get a haircut 2 months ago so i could get rid of my split ends and this shampoo made my hair soft and it hydrated the top of my hair i think many people think or say that that it tangles your hair and i only experienced that the first few uses and not using hot water 
2015-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|you would think by all the recent negative reviews that this shampoo is a loser but for some reason it really works for me i have dark brown shoulder length fine straight hair with deposit only color i was using the same brand sea mineral moisture line over the winter and before that the regular coconut line which my husband loves those were too heavy over the summer so i got the weightless coconut shampoo and conditioner i had been using a serum and a workable hair spray up to this point as well what i have noticed with the weightless coconut is more body and shine and i have also stopped using any styling products at all i was not able to find the weightless coconut spray and hairspray was just drying my hair out so i quit everything except wash and condition i have been doing this for several weeks and have shiny healthy looking hair i love just blow drying and going i know this is not for everyone but my hair feels so good i can t stop touching it worth a try if you use the conditioner also i would not use just the shampoo as it will tangle one gripe is the dome shaped top when the product runs low you cannot turn it upside down easily i have to prop it up in the shower niche and it sometimes falls loudly into the tub usually in the middle of the night ogx please redesign the round top 
2015-08|1.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|this shampoo is the worst it made my hair so tangled and my hair is usually pretty easy to deal with my rating for this product is too high 
2014-08|1.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i absolutely hated this shampoo and the conditioner as well my hair is pin straight and very fine so the idea of quot weightless hydration quot seemed awesome it smells great at first but the scent does not last longer than a few hours through the day the worst thing about this shampoo though is that it actually dried my hair out terribly i tossed it after using it for 2 weeks i don t recommend it at all 
2014-08|2.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i really loved the coconut scent and had great luck with this brand before keratin shampoo conditioner but never until now have i had so many tiny little knots in my hair i tried doing the 3 step suggestion but with the keratin oil spray but i still wasn t happy i finally gave up after a month 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i m so glad that i read all of the reviews for this this is great i ve been using salon products but ran out of my usual and needed something inexpensive one of the reviewers said that you need to use the entire 3 step system they were right if you just use the shampoo and conditioner it doesn t work as well you must use the coconut water treatment after it sprays in and seriously leaves your hair looking like you just left the salon 
2014-08|4.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|a very good shampoo i bought it on sale for 13 50 from priceline where it usually retails at around 18 everything in australia is expensive ergh anyways it smells really goos and both nourishes my hair while adding a bit of volume to my very fine limp hair i have had it for about 2 months and am only 1 3 of the way through i was my hair once every other day so it lasts a pretty long time
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|amazing smell so addicted to this lightweight clean yet moisturising shampoo ive got naturally oily but easily tangled hair due to having my hair permed so the dilemma was finding a shampoo that would not leave my hair oily but not dry out my hair so this shampoo did the trick the only issue is that it s quite expensive for a little bottle 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i have to write this review because i think the product is underrated and probably not used correctly for those who scored it low firstly i have straight thick hair and it is quite picky in that the roots go oily quickly but i can t overwash as this irritates my scalp so i shampoo every 2nd day and then my ends are bristly thick hair and can become dry i ve tried heaps of shampoo and so far this is awesome but you do have to use the whole set as recommended 3 steps if you only use the shampoo in this set it makes your hair very knotty and dry even if you follow through with another organix conditioner i ve tried it with the argan oil one and the cherry blossom if you use the coconut water shampoo and condition the result is nice but not wow then the other day the treatment oil was on sale so i decided to try and oh my goodness i should have done this from the start the whole 3 steps was easy to use you towel dry your hair after shampoo and condition then spray evenly through and only blow dry for a little bit so i feel like my hair is really hydrated the end result is a very silky sheeny but not oily nor course looking hair it was quite magical in the bathroom like i just stepped out of a salon my course ends are so plump and hydrated that it appears like i ve got more volume in my hair amazing 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i ve used this one time so far along with the conditioner and spray it left my hair feeling soft and silky and light with no gross oily effect i used the spray just on the very ends of my hair once i towel dried it i love all of it and can t wait to use it again my hair feels great and healthy very happy with my results i m also happy with the price of these products i usually have to spend about 22 per bottle to get results like i got with these i let my hair dry naturally my hair is fine and straight and tends to get oily fast 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|love the shampoo it smells great and is perfect on my long hair my hair is color treated thick and very long my entire family 2 men and 2 women all with different hair needs love thus product i don t find it oily or drying at all my daughter has short oil prone hair and she loved it also great product
2014-08|3.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|this was an okay shampoo it smelled amazing and the gel like texture was cool but it made me oilier and the days went on i couldn t go more than a day without washing funny since i can go up to four co washing it did make my hair soft but prone to grease maybe the coconut oil content was too high it has no sulfates or silicones and lathered well more of a creamy foam than a sudsy one it was okay but i won t repurchase 
2014-08|2.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i tried this it was meh not very hydrating and didn t make my hair feel soft it works just like a 1 00 bottle of suave shampoo in my opinion i replaced this with something more hydrating and im now using this as a hand soap haha 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i love this shampoo it smells great and thoroughly but gently cleanses my short medium fine hair 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i love this stuff i had been using their biotin shampoo cond for a year or so and decided to try this out since they had a deal at ulta this smell to me is exactly the scent that makes me melt with love coconuts it lathers very well and even though my hair didn t feel all smooth and glossy in the shower after i styled it blow dried it felt great i also use the conditioner which works as well 
2014-08|1.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|my hair still feels and looks so dry i don t like the smell either it s not horrible just not for me and it drys my scalp i have minor dandruff now from this product 
2014-08|4.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|i have dry hair and this shampoo really gave it moisture and shine without making giving it a greasy oily feel to it however it does not help with frizz as this really fluffed up my hair i think i will save this bottle for the summer months when east texas is really humid and my hair tends to get really really dry looking like straw the smell is amazing i can not stop raving it just really smells like a tropical coconut paradise no joke the smell is incredibly great it really tempts you to grab some pina coladas and sit out by a pool or beach sigh i got this bogo at walgreens price is 7 99usd at walgreens so i was able to get two of them not a bad deal at all i didn t get the conditioner as i find that most ogx shampoos are really creamy 
2013-08|2.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|another organix product that left me disappointed this shampoo was really drying and left my hair feeling gnarly in the shower it stripped my hair yet somehow managed to leave my roots feeling greasy at the same time this was just ick for me which is a bummer because i had high hopes for it i always get sucked in by organix products because i m a sucker for their cute packaging i have tried almost all of their lines and so far the only ones i ve liked are the awapuhi ginger argan oil of morocco the new formula version and right now i m trying their new sea mineral moisture line and liking it so far i would suggest those for anyone with hair like mine color treated dry and prone to split ends breakage 
2013-08|4.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo|found this at walgreens i love coconut scented stuff and coconut water and oil and milk are all awesome hydrating ingredients so i figured it was worth a try i also love that it is sulfate free both sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate this did a great job of cleansing my hair i had split end mender in my hair it actually created a creamy lather which is surprising because the formula is completely colorless and clear i have not experienced any dryness or uncharacteristic tangles typical of a shampoo that does not work well with my hair i believe i will like this shampoo i am always a fan of sulfate free shampoos i cannot account for the matching conditioner i m quite fond of my current conditioner so i m going to stick to just using the shampoo from this line i ll update later 
2019-08|3.0|Shea Soft & Smooth|it has very strong fragrance but i loved it so i bought it definitely is not enjoyable if you feel sick i think it makes my hair go greasy faster it s price aprox 10 euro 11 usd is in the higher range but it is just like any other shampoo to be honest except stronger perfume that smells more lux won t be buying it again i guess 
2018-08|2.0|Shea Soft & Smooth|this is supposed to defrizz and smooth hair with shea butter and agave nectar this shampoo uses a harsh surfactant that left my hair feeling dry and stripped has a pleasant shea butter and coconut milk scent 
2019-08|5.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |this stuff is awesomesauce i ve been using this oil for years and i swear it has made a huge difference with my fine color treated straight dry and damaged hair i lighten my hair every month being that it is baby fine it can develop a lot of dryness and damage this oil is absolutely wonderful i use it two ways i use it after washing my hair while it s still damp but after towel drying i spray it in and it completely helps reduce tangling while i m blow drying i find that it makes my hair so silky and smooth i also use this after my hair is dried i spray a little on the ends of my hair and wait for a couple of minutes for it to absorb i go ahead and brush my hair and it makes my hair so soft and shiny i have tried other leave in treatments and oils but none of them have absorbed into my hair like this one does usually they leave my hair feeling greasy and flat this one doesn t initially it will look a little oily but after a few minutes it penetrates the hair shaft and makes it feel stronger the smell is a bit strong but i find it pleasant it also dissipates after a minute or two i will continue to buy this it is very affordable and i can find it at my local walmart sometimes on sale for around 7 8 cad definitely worth a try as soon as my next bottle gets low i m going to be purchasing another this is truly an amazing product 
2016-08|5.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |i ve used every oil imaginable but this is hands down hg material light weight smells great and work well on my fine but thick hair it maintains volume and shines 
2016-08|5.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |literally the best hair product spray ever would recommend for wavy curly hair due to the fact that people who have straight hair might feel that this product makes is oily er quicker than normal apply from neck down and run through your hair using your hands to apply the excess to the top of your head makes hair feel weightless and make it look suppperr healthy 
2015-08|5.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |love this stuff this is the first oil i have used on my hair that feels like it hasn t made the condition worse and it doesn t weigh my hair down or make it look like an oil tanker has been wrecked on my head i quite like the smell it s fruity and clean strong but doesn t linger i don t follow the directions on the bottle and spray it directly into my hair i don t have enough hair for that i spray once into my hand rub my palms together and massage it through the tips and the frizzies at the front of my hair it definitely seems to help with the breakage i have a thyroid condition that wasn t treated properly and the bald spots are finally filling in my hair is smooth and silky despite it being windy and cold and dry where i m living now 
2015-08|5.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |love this i have very naturally curly hair 3b and have been on a straightening kick for the past few months and after my last trim in early december i added this to my routine this stuff has really helped my hair a lot due the heat straightening etc i have hardly no split ends amp my hair doesn t feel dried out i don t spray this on to my hair unless i use it on my ends when its wet i mainly use it on my hair when its dry and i spray about 2 pumnps in my hands rub together and run it through the length of my hair this stuff smells amazing like a nice light warm perfume also i ve used this on my natural spiral curls and love it it never makes my curls look greasy or droopy i love how lightweight this oil is 
2015-08|4.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |i freaking love this spray i noticed my hair becoming dry with really bad split ends i stop using hot tools on my hair trimmed my hair every 4weeks and used this spray lightly on my wet or dry hair and my hair is super soft and silky and not to mention how much my hair has frowns in the last 6 months d so so sooooo impressed the smell of this spray is unbelievable if it was acceptable to use as a perfume i totally would haha i love the little bottle it comes in so classy and clean i have had mine for 2 years now and i haven t even hit the half way mark d if you want to try this amazing product hit up your local priceline store and grab it now d xo
2014-08|5.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |only been using it a few days but seems great so far my hair is so dry right now from over dying it and i m hoping this will help so far so good i ve so far i lu used it on dry hair and it hasn t felt greasy at all and i love the smell smells like a nice light perfume 
2014-08|5.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |my hair was very dry and brittle today since i did not shampoo today and i used this on dry hair and no more tangles i love the smell as well 
2014-08|5.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |love his stuff this is the only spraying oil that has helped my dry hair tremendously doesn t leave your hair greasy or weighed down can t live without it 
2014-08|5.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |i bought this on a whim at walgreens i adore most of the styling oils from organix and figured this would be nice to try out it is not sticky or greasy feeling and is very light i can actually spray this liberally and not worry about it dragging down my curls it does provide moderate shine for me and smooths down any frizzy and puffy areas the smell of this is great i can t stop smelling my hair whenever i apply this spray and i am grateful that it lingers for a quite a bit to my nose it is a fruity scent with a hint of musk i have definitely smelled it somewhere before but can t figure out what it is i might have to google it lol this is a light protein based spray for me and i haven t had any problems using it daily worth a shot if your hair is feeling a bit brittle or dull 
2014-08|4.0|Keratin oil instant repair spray |i have tried many shine sprays but this one is silicone free and absolutely weightless usually treatment sprays or gels go on unevenly but this one has a good spray i get a great finishing shine on my wavy hair great after a beach day if you hair is wind blown and a bit frizzy i usually do not comment on the scents of products but this one is so designer smelling that i sometimes use it on my hair even if i do not need it so my hair smells great when people hug me it sort of smells like a very very mild version of angel or fuel for life for women a must have girls with waves and girls 
2019-08|4.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter|i was using shae moisture fruit infused coconut water for the longest time about 4 tubs until i switched to this i ran out of the shae one and thought why not give this a go since i love anything coconut and i already use the ogx coconut milk shampoo as a hg so i bought this on a whim so happy i tried it i love how it can be a rinse off or a leave in it doesnt weigh hair down and does not have an offensive smell its a barely there light coconut water scent i love it for days where i dont have a lot of time to shower and wait for hair conditioners or i need to rinse fast and get out it doesnt make my hair sticky or greasy and i literally dont need to rinse that much before getting out the shower since this can be used as a leave in for busy moms out there who cannot have the luxury to do shampoo conditioner hair mask and all this is the best little gem ive found to make my showers quick but effective i highly recommend this product if you have medium thickness long black hair like me i suffer from hair loss from time to time and also tangles i have straight to wavy hair and i cant say this makes my hair more curly but it does condition it well not as great as a deep conditoning mask and feels smells really nice id repurchase this to use as a leave in but i wouldnt use this by itself for conditioning i find that using this after my conditioner is best i wish this conditioned a bit more but i dont think its intended to replace a mask i will go back to my shae moisture fruit infusion but this is really nice to have in my hair care routine 
2018-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter|love love love this product i have curly hair 3b and use this as a leave in conditioner after washing my hair my hair is silky smooth after using this product and stays soft and hydrated for several days great product for curly girls 
2018-08|1.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter|i have fine naturally curly hair when i couldn t find my paul mitchell s curls therapy and hadn t yet ordered my bounce curl hair cream i picked this up first use i showered at night and washed my hair i used the product then hair plopped as i slept i do this all of the time with fabulous results except this time i would not recommend this product to anyone with fine curly hair my curls were separated limp no lift no bounce and frizzy i will never use this product again and have already ordered my bounce curl 
2017-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter|this is an amazing leave in cream that will completely change your life i m not even exaggerating i have curly hair and like all of us curlies know we are frizzy as hell without leave in i ve been compared to hagrid from harry potter enter this product my hair has never been so smooth curly and healthy looking this is definitely some powerful stuff so you only need a very small amount it also smells amazing and i ve received so many compliments on it especially when it s wet haha i imagine even non curlies could benefit from this as well you d just need to use waaaay less from what i can tell it doesn t have any properties that would make you curly it just helps the curls if they re already there don t know why it s only marketed to curly girls but whatever i like to use this product in conjunction with a curl activator and a curl gel i find that all three have made my hair the best it s ever been and i m super pleased with the result i totally suggest doing so if you find this product alone isn t giving you the definition and curl you were looking for 
2017-08|3.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter|i finally finished up my container of this product it lasted me just over 6 months and although i didn t use it daily i would estimate i used it about 4 days per week on average the paackaging is okay but i did not like that this product is constantly exposed to the air when i was using it i would prefer a squeeze tube for a thick product that is able to dry out if the lid is not on i found it tedious to constantly unscrew and screw the cap back on with every use i also have long nails and disliked that product would usually get trapped under them after use since you have to dig into this product due to the packaging i have hair that is down to my bra strap in the back and i prefer to use a pea sized amount if i use more than that my hair can look stringy i only applied this to the bottom half of my hair and not the roots i love the smell it smells like true coconut and not that sweet fake coconut fragrance at first i used this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner from the same line then later with organix sea mineral moisture shampoo and conditioner it behaved approximately the same with both but i will mention i vastly prefer the sea mineral line to this coconut curls line because my hair really needs the moisture and became a bit dried out when i was using only the coconut curls products i used this on its own for about half the tub then for the other half of the tub of product i used it mixed with it s a 10 serum i like neither one of these leave in conditioners alone but have really been enjoying them mixed together i used one pea size of this hair butter and then one half a squirt of the it s a 10 serum i decided to mix them because when used alone this product did take away frizz and make hair smoother and more moisturized looking but my hair was not actually benefiting from it i still got the same amount of split ends when i went for my hair trims and dryness at the ends of my hair on days when i didn t use it with the combo i have had slightly less split ends and my ends are more moisturized when i skip any hair products and just shampoo and condition due to laziness overall i will not be repurchasing and will continue experimenting with new products i wouldn t recommend this because there is no lasting benefit to using this in my opinion and to me that is the whole point of using a leave in treatment 
2016-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter|so i acquired this at a family reunion i was running low on the oil i put in my hair so i thought i would try it i have not tried as a conditioner to rinse out but i absolutely adore it as a leave in the smell is amazing and i don t think my hair has been so soft and bouncy in the longest time i don t have to use a lot to get what i wanted i would without a single doubt buy this numerous times over i can t wait to see how it fairs in the winter weather but with the humid summer weather it keeps my hair from going into a frizzy uncontrollable mess so it already scored wonderfully to me 
2015-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter|for reference i have thin wavy hair 2a and lots of it i ve been dying my hair for almost 20 years it was looking dull and limp ogx released this line new for 2016 i was browsing walgreen s hair selection in search of a new deep conditioner and or leave in as my current ones were running out and did nothing to whoa me to repurchase thats when this quenching coconut curls line caught my attention i initially only purchased this curling hair butter to use as a deep conditioner thinking as a leave in it would be much to heavy for my fine hair and if your looking for a moisture boost its great to use but you guys as a leave in o m g my curls have so much life and bounce to them curls i didn t even know i had you only need a tiny bit as this is a very rich moisturizing conditioner it smells divine the texture is so buttery my hair looks 10 times healthier in just a few weeks i loved this so much i went out and bought the matching frizz defying moisture mousse and will soon be purchasing the shampoo and conditioner to try out 
2015-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter|from the ogx website lather on this versatile hair butter to boost your curls hydration leave it in for a moisturizing treatment or rinse it out for use as a deep conditioner i ve used this as a deep conditioner amp i love it its also great as a leave in i have naturally spiral curly hair 3b mixed with 3a amp 3c s and got this last year when it 1st came out when using it as a leave in a little goes a long way imo my hair is bra strap length the scent is coconutty amp tropical this keeps my dry curls moisturized without feeling weighed down 
2019-08|3.0|Bodifying + Bamboo Fibre Full Spray Mousse|i think this works ok if you re going to spray it directly on your roots to give some lift when you blow dry this did not leave my hair stiffer crunchy and had to sent of vanilla i probably won t repurchase this product 
2018-08|1.0|Bodifying + Bamboo Fibre Full Spray Mousse|with my limp fine locks i m always on the lookout for the next product that might give my mane a little boost recently i was surveying the ogx line for its new products and the spray mousse caught my eye thanks to its attractive packaging and the promise of bodifying effect when i saw the mousse on sale at a local drugstore i had to have it as i m sitting with my hair now dry but previously drenched with the mousse as instructed i have only regrets money wasted hair akin to dry straw the product did not work for my fine hair but then who with bodacious locks would be looking to increase volume not sure who the mousse is designed for 
2018-08|4.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Thickening Root Booster|i actually really liked this the only thing is if you use too much it gives your hair a stiff texture 
2016-08|1.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Thickening Root Booster|this is for the root booster not to be confused with the fiber cream the bottles are almost identical except for the nozzle this one has a spray nozzle with a cover so you can spray it close to the roots the instructions say to quot lightly mist quot onto clean damp hair concentrating on the roots you can t lightly mist very well with the type of nozzle but it is good for getting the product into the roots it is a watery solution with little to no scent that is easy to work into roots once sprayed i tried this on 3 separate occasions after using my usual shampoo amp conditioner and styling the usual way it failed hugely 3 times i used 3 8 sprays trying different techniques to see if maybe i was using too much or too little product all had the same results i have thin medium thickness hair cut into a pixie that i wear messy this made my hair look completely flat like a hair helmet no matter what i did it turned out the same epic fail tony amp guys volume plumping whip is infinitely better 
2018-08|2.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full|while ogx products generally smell great the scents do not linger in your hair past the shower some of their translucent shampoos have an odd gelatinous texture that causes a lot of waste think semi set jello you literally have to put the shampoo on your head because it will fall out of your hands i find that the product doesn t lather with the ease of most shampoos the upside to this product is it doesn t contain methylprop long ingredient name at the end of most shampoo ingredient lists that causes kidney problems 
2017-08|1.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full|this shampoo has been one of the worst i ve ever tried it dried up my daughter s scalp amp mine i have oily roots and it made both our scalp itchy it smells good but that was the only plus 
2017-08|5.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full|this shampoo plus the conditioner really saved my hair after i stupidely bleached it with the infamous hydrogen peroxide amp baking soda recipe my hair was fried brittle it didn t move anymore and felt horrible to the touch literally after one wash with both the shampoo amp conditioner my hair returned to life it actually made my hair super soft and bouncy again plus it smells really good it doesn t really make my hair quot full quot or voluminous it mostly just made my hair soft again which made me happy because i was sad for damaging my hair this is what i ve been using since and it has helped my hair a lot i recommend this if you have dry damaged hair 
2017-08|4.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full|good shampoo makes hair nice and clean and the conditioner is nice as well 
2017-08|3.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full|this has a strong fresh green type of scent it is a good shampoo that cleanses well and does not leave my fine dry hair feeling like straw it did nothing to add volume to my hair even when used with the matching conditioner 
2017-08|3.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full|i ll be honest i bought this shampoo because of the scent don t know why the fragrance of shampoos is so important to me but i will not buy one that doesn t smell nice not matter how well it s reviewed this has such a light floral sort of white tea scent and it s in a pretty emerald green bottle but i don t like the product unfortunately it has the strangest jelly texture i ve ever experienced it spurts out of the bottle in clumps and doesn t flow at all have to shake the bottle hard to get it into the neck i hate the ogx bottles since with rounded caps you can t store them inverted have to use more than i d like to get it to lather and clean my hair and i really don t notice any thickening just more of a dry tangly result i ll use it up as a shower gel and not repurchase 
2018-08|3.0|Pomegranate & Ginger Conditioner|great scent mostly pomegranate but there is a zingy note that must be the ginger this is just too light a conditioner my hair is fine and straight this left me with flyaways static and no detangling effect it us good for summertime only nice scent though and definitely doesn t leave build up so that s good 
2018-08|4.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i said i wouldn t buy this product again because right now i m experimenting with different shampoos to see which one i need so when this one runs out i will be trying a different one if only to compare i ve been growing my hair out for a couple of years now and it s gotten fairly long i m proud however breakage has become an issue i don t even know if it s breakage or just losing hair from my scalp but there is a lot in the shower when i m done and even more coming out in my hands once it s dry i have oily ish roots and dry ends like most people with longer straight hair i would assume i usually wash my hair every 2 or 3 days second day is a hair up day and if i go 3 days it s a dry shampoo day up i go around looking greasy i really don t care that much my hair is decently thick medium to thick maybe but the hair itse f is fine i hope that makes sense i usually only shampoo my roots and keep conditioner away from my roots i just flip the rest of my hair over the top of my head as i m rinsing so there s some moisture there but nothing that will weigh down my hair or make it oily a lot of shampoos in that past have made my scalp itchy after washing them to i figured i would try sulfate free okay so this stuff i like it the shampoo is really thick which i kind of like because i don t accidentally squeeze out too much with a sulfate free shampoo the sulfates aren t doing all of the work for you so you really have to make sure that you rub it into your scalp i like this shampoo because i can wash all of my hair down to the ends and they don t get crunchy the conditioner is actually less thick than others that i ve used i still do my usual quot no roots quot routine with this one i usually use probably way more conditioner than i need but i ve been doing well at limiting myself with this one and it seems fine once i m done i ve found that it s really easy to gently brush my hair when it s wet before it s even dry it feels softer and silkier i have noticed less fallout with both wet and dry hair too this stuff makes my hair soft and silky maybe too much so because i think my hair is more prone to static with this line my second day hair seems oiler than before i started with this line but i also am just figuring out how to use a sulfate free shampoo so this may be due to user error or it could be because it doesn t dry my scalp to oblivion less itchy scalp is probably worth it i haven t tried going three days without washing it s just too much i m working on it and i ll update when i finish what i have now pros smells nice don t need a lot soft hair sulfate free doesn t dry out my hair less fallout cons static prone more oily on day 2 overall i like it my next bottle will probably be a different line from ogx 
2017-08|1.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|genuinely one of the worst shampoos i ve ever tried along with the conditioner from the same range it did absolutely nothing for my hair except make it feel like straw and leave it unmanageable it was almost impossible to get out of the bottle because its consistency is so thick and the scent is overpoweringly strong to the point where it actually gave me a headache i used it 4 times then threw it in the garbage 
2017-08|2.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|nope it makes my hair too thick the product itself is thick and comes out as a log which i drop on the floor in the shower i don t like the conditioner either 
2017-08|2.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i have very fine thin hair that breaks easily this did nothing to strengthen my hair i waited to give my review after using the entire bottle in case it needed to build up hair still breaks easily it wasn t a bad shampoo but nothing special i also went thru it very fast because it is a thick formula also the containers are annoyingly thick so you can t get it all out 
2016-08|4.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i have bought this shampoo when i realised that a lot of drugstore shampoos i ve been using have sulfate in them which is apparently very bad for your hair i have very thin oily hair with dry ends from coloring it and it was very hard for me to switch to sulfate free shampoo since it doesn t foam as much and leaves a feeling of not freshly washed hair but when a preson gets used to it the difference is noticable my hair seems to fall out less it is shinier and it doesn t get a lot more oily but not any less either the smell is fantastic but i would prefer it sticks longer it fades when you rinse your hair almost immediately after rinsing my hair i use dove hair mask which is good but i would like to try ogx conditioner but the price is just too much it is around 10 euros and i am aware that with all this youtube and internet craze those prices are considered cheap but that number is not as low for an avarege consumer i don t wash my hair every day i wash it every forth so it lasts me but man it is a shampoo i literally wash it down the drain so 20 euros for shampoo and conditioner are a bit too high prices for my taste all in all here are pros and cons pros less hair loss shinier hair smells great cons price smell fades away immediately doesn t reduce oiliness 
2016-08|3.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i m on the search for a new shampoo and conditioner combo that prevents breakage as i have fly aways like you wouldn t believe mostly caused by brushing my long straight hair too much with the wrong brush but possibly also due to using harsh shampoos i figured i might as well review the different products i m trying out since this site is informing my choices this one felt good in the shower but i actually had more frizz and fly aways the next day i can t tell whether or not it can prevent breakage but i m not a fan of the look it gives me i ll finish using it on days when i don t care how my hair looks but likely won t repurchase will edit if i change my mind about how it works 
2016-08|4.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i love this it strengthened my hair and gave it some shine too in my opinion it didn t lather very well so i had wasted a lot 
2016-08|5.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|hello everyone and i am here to write a review on the organix anti breakage keratin shampoo i purchased the shampoo conditioner and a keratin spray i have tried a few of the organix shampoo conditioners i have tried the brazilian keratin renewing argan oil coconut milk and macadamia oil the coconut milk line and the anti breakage keratin are my two faves i was in harmon which by the way has the lowest every day price to buy the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and styling products but i could not resist this one i will say the coconut milk and anti breakage keratin are both great i love this one a little more the packaging is cute and durable and they have different sizes i keep using this one even though i have more coconut milk left it lathers well it smells incredible and after i shampoo and rinse it leaves my hair soft and the conditioner just adds more softness the conditioner is thick but not too thick it does not weigh my hair down if anything it gives my hair volume and my hair doesn t feel greasy on a few days of no washing also i purchased the brazilian keratin spray not the anti breakage spray because they did not have it in stock but honestly the one i have is great and i use it on my towel dried hair then again before i flat iron it all of their products smell incredible great cute durable packaging great quality for the price and it s not tested on animals and the packaging is made from recycled materials all in all i love this brand and i love trying new ones i have been using it for a few weeks 
2016-08|2.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|it smeels peculiar but not bad but i didn t feels this shampoo even doing anything it adds a lot of freeze and rlease dandruff i didn t feel less breakage so 
2015-08|5.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i hated this when i first bought it i thought it left my hair feeling straw like i realised i was using far too much shampoo as this is very concentrated stuff a bit of water swished on my palms and with the matching conditioner yes also very concentrated i have never used so little conditioner in my life my hair is in the best form it s been in for years it smells very fruity passionfruit i think i like the smell but it s very strong at first i can t smell it in my hair though 
2015-08|1.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|all the shampoos of this brand are by far the oiliest and greasiest i have ever encountered in the shower i washed my hair with a clarifying shampoo after washing it with this one and it still made me breakout everywhere returned all the rest of the products of the organix brand 
2015-08|3.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i want so much to love organix products because the packaging is super adorable but sadly they haven t done anything to really make me go quot wow quot so far i ve tried three different ones amp they haven t changed my hair in any way shape or form i feel like i m better off without wasting my money or hope on them any more i have this one in the conditioner and it hasn t made my hair smooth or anything that it claims i might try again in a while but for now i don t see any reason to keep trying maybe my hair is just stubborn but idk not impressed amp 128547 
2015-08|5.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|just bought my second bottle of this thought i d finally write a review i have a long dyed wavy frizzy mess of hair ogx is a company i ve been getting comfortable with for the past year and i have finally settled on a favourite quot flavor quot this shampoo is thick thick thick i often mix in some warm water in my palm to loosen up the formula a bit definitely not a con if anything its like having a super concentrated shampoo and definitely saves it the smell is fantastic i havent been able to put my finger on it but it smells sweet and wonderful and warm like an amber and vanilla the boyfriend loves it after use my hair does not feel weighed down it smells great and very smooth will use til i find something better 
2014-08|5.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|my holy grail shampoo i havent been keeping up with the care of my hair was a while and kept using things thats not suitable as a result my hair becomes extremely dry with alot of breakageâ but this shampoo transformed my hairâ everyone notice the improvement and hair has become much softer and manageableâ i have gone through half a bottle before i write this review and my hair will take a while to recoveryâ but its working the only complain i have is the smellâ its just really sweet and fruity like some cheap perfumeâ for now i will just suck it up and keep using it highly recommended 
2014-08|5.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i heard about this shampoo because a friend recommended it to me and let me just say i m glad she did not only have i tried this one but i also tried the coconut one but i tried the travel size ones and i didn t like those i mean i like the smell but it just dried out my hair but this shampoo smelled amazing and left my hair really soft i couldn t get over the smell and it lasted me a really long time and i would recommend this product 
2014-08|2.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|updated bad shampoo so thick and leaves my hair sticky and gross found a new hg product 
2014-08|4.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|this shampoo made my hair shiny clean and soft i looove the smell of it its just not very long lasting i would recomend this to someone with thick long hair though as it weighs down hair a little bit 
2014-08|5.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|love this bought it at cotco with conditioner and oil spray works great for my frizzy hair from the hard water here in calgary 
2013-08|4.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i have fine and oily hair for the first few weeks this shampoo worked great for me my hair was soft and manageable however its effectiveness wore down i suggest alternating shampoos so your hair won t get used to the shampoo paid 13aud at chemist warehouse sydney 
2013-08|5.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|my new favorite shampoo been using it for a month now and i still love it i also have the keratin oil conditioner and i use them together started using this product because i was having issues with my hair breaking and split ends pros adorable packaging not too big doesn t take up a lot of room on my shower rack smells great smells kind of strong in the shower but it s not as strong when you get done using it so don t get thrown off lathers very nice not drying at all very hydrating and makes my hair feel silky smooth i noticed a big difference in how much hair is coming off on my brush even when i brush my hair wet barely any hair breaks off anymore great price got both the shampoo and conditioner for about 12 dollars separately they cost around 5 6 dollars i also feel like this kept my hair very clean and fresh didn t get oily as fast as usual and i was able to skip washing my hair the next day it didn t dry out my hair just kept it clean yet very smooth cons none 
2013-08|4.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|keratin oil shampoo by organix contains keratin and argan oil it leaves the hair smoother and thicker they are super shinny too love it 
2013-08|4.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i love this shampoo i am very picky with my hair products and this just might be my new hg when used in combination with the conditioner my hair feels softer and healthier than it did with paul mitchell wild ginger awapuhi moisturizing shampoo go figure this stuff smells great and for only 6 at wal mart it can t be beat i am now addicted to the organix line 
2013-08|4.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i absolutely love this oil both for my natural hair and as a mist on my synthetic extensions it smells amazing like warm vanilla with coconut and a hint of something i can t quite place it s lighter than most oils and the bottle sprays a very fine mist all for less than salon brands of keratin and argan oil will definitely buy again 
2013-08|4.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i purchased this along with the conditioner and 3 minute miracle about two weeks ago i have frizzy color treated hair with severely damaged ends i ve noticed less breakage as well as my hair is far softer and smoother i really like this product
2013-08|3.0|Anti Breakage Keratin oil|i love the organix brand overall i decided to try this new product of theirs because i get severe split ends and i was interested in keratin treatment this shampoo has a light pleasant but unidentifiable sent it does not create much lather but that s typical of shampoos that try to use more natural ingredients and less sulphates i did not like that it left an oily residue on my skin that was difficult to wash off afterwards it was a passable cleaner for my hair but i will be going back to one of my old favorites because after several weeks of use i did not see a noticable difference in the reduction of split ends or breakage 
2018-08|4.0|OGX Quenching Sea Mineral Moisture Body Wash|my favorite thing about this product is actually the smell it strikes a rare balance of fresh and soft without bordering into something artificial like men s shaving cream territory it s smooth and oceanic i would scent my house with a fragrance like this so i bought it after smelling it in the drugstore 1 for the fragrance 2 pretty good size for the price 3 because it s sls free after seeing what a difference it made going sls free with my hair cleaning it without stripping it of its natural moisture barrier i thought it would probably be a good thing to try for the skin on my body too however i was skeptical of how moisturizing this would be maybe it s just marketing but i ve come to associate clear body washes with not moisturizing and opaque body washes with moisturizing properties i know how stupid that sounds but it s hard to overcome some of those associations anyways i ve gone through 2 bottles in the spring and summer and i really like it i felt clean but with none of that prickly dry feeling that sends you running for the body lotion after the shower the smell is awesome while you re in the shower but it doesn t linger on your skin that said i don t think it s going to be quite moisturizing enough in the winter so i ll be trying out the ogx coconut body wash to see how that goes i will definitely repurchase the sea mineral moisture body wash in the summer for something fresh and lightly moisturizing 
2017-08|4.0|OGX Quenching Sea Mineral Moisture Body Wash|recently i figured out that algae make my skin baby soft so i was looking for a shower gel that contains it and found ogx quenching sea mineral moisture body wash pros make my skin really soft cleans well love the thick translucent texture got tired of cream like dove shower gels no sulfates or other nasty ingredients if you like a lot of lather this is not for you no sulfates shower products don t lather cons i m not a fan of the smell to me it smells like a toilet bowl cleaner or a very commercial men s care product the good news it that smell doesn t linger it goes away as soon as you rinse it off i ll buy it again despite the smell just because of performance 
2018-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|just remembered to write a review on this it s not a salon quality at home treatment hence the price point this lasts supposedly 30 days rather than months it is a good alternative if you prefer diy or even don t want to shell out so much at once for a professional service but there are better options for at home keratin treatments on the market research around did this last 30 days for me no was the results amazing no but it did strengthen and defrizz my hair quite a bit for a few weeks hair felt sleeker just not miraculously this is pretty fool proof for any newbies out there just keep your hair dry amp straight a few days after applying i have a lot of hair and it s long it was waist length the last time i used this the entire bottle is supposed to be one application but i used way less than that a little goes a long way so it lasted for several treatments further improving the bang for my buck one thing i did hate is how disgusting this feels while it s sitting on my hair a lot of them are like that though i can t go anywhere during the 48 72 processing period as it looks scary greasy 
2016-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i really like this product for making my hair silky and soft i have very curly fine shoulder length hair which i ve been blowing out for years luckily my hair is already pretty manageable i use this product every couple of months or so and i don t use very much at all just a couple of squirts to run through the ends of my hair and around my ears the hardest part to keep straight i m giving it 4 5 because of the lack of straightening overall but i am thrilled with the softness i think this product may be discontinued i haven t seen it in store in a long time i hope it s still around 
2015-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i tried this treatment in 2012 there are many people that would find fault with this product but i was quite satisfied for the most part the instructions were easy to follow and blow drying was like a dream my blow drying time was cut in half taking about 20 minutes instead of 45 however the flat ironing process and everything that came after that was pretty tedious i used the highest setting of heat and straightened small sections of hair a total of 10 times but that s a lot of sections and it took a lot of time afterwards my hair felt very waxy but was quite shiny the treatment had to then be kept in the hair for 48 hours and then washed out to be blow dried and flat ironed again i experienced no reversion while my hair was straight until the humidity levels shot up like a madman also 95 of my curl was not eliminated 60 maybe i would recommend this product to anyone who wants to escape the price of a professional bkt and those who may have a problem with frizz or blow drying their hair altogether all in all i would buy it again but it s not something i need or can t live without i was happy with the results though minus my hair reverting when the weather got humid for a more in depth review you can check out my blogpost http teayii blogspot com 2013 07 review organix brazilian keratin html

2014-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i used this product last month my hair looked very nice for the first two days it was very nice sleek and straight but after i washed my hair again it was back to the frizzy poofy mess i tried again and i got the exact same thing it really shouldn t be called quot 30 day straight quot if it only lasts for two it only cost 14 but that it a waste since the product didn t do what it was advertised as

2014-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|final update after 2nd use i used it again after 30 days i used a 450 f flat iron to seal the product in and i think it made all the difference results i blow dryed and flat ironed my hair after the wash 1 i did not lose my curl pattern my hair still had waves in it it hadn t become completely straight 2 less blow drying and flat iron time 3 my hair looks smooth shiny and has the quot healthy quot look to it it kind of has a nice swing to it my hair has more movement and it is more fluid 4 it is holding up well without frizzing up in humidity cons it has horrible wet dog stench to it after washing its just horrendous and unbearable final thoughts i may purchase this again because you cant go wrong for 15 and i really like this product but the effects are not long lasting i d rather buy a 50 product whose effect last for 3 months or so its a pita to do this treatment every month that being said i d recommend this for anyone looking for a smoothing treatment on budget and formaldehyde free this product is worth its price updat week 2 3 my hair is starting to feel normal already partly because i got into the pool a few days back i think the chlorinated water ruined the treatment the back of my hair is starting to get frizzy rest of the hair is fine no frizz and my hair is getting poofy 1 lippie off for that my ends are starting to look brassy and fried they seemed healthy right after the treatment all in all i think you get what you pay for but do try this product its a decent treatment for the price will i buy this again i dont know i am gonna try doing this again with a 450 flat iron after 30 days and i ll see if its any better the second time i ve always been interested in trying out keratin treatments since i ve heard about them i dont have 300 to shell out for bkt at salon and decided to do a at home keratin treatment so i got this you know just to test the waters what i was looking for i have a 2b ish wavy thick asian hair i wanted to cut down my blow drying time it takes 30 45 minutes and its a pita trying to tame down the frizzies and also relax my waves about the process few observations i did not notice any fumes but the smell is certainly not pleasant please do it in a well ventilated area do it when you have time it is plain torture to just sit for 48 hours with a helmet head and trying to straighten out the kinks results my blowdrying time was cut to 15 mins i was ecstatic and it was a breeze to blow dry my hair i blow dry it with a round brush and its always me sweating huffing and puffing every mornig i love this stuff curl pattern i havent air dryed my hair but my curl pattern remained the same on wet hair so i dont think this did anything to straighten my waves i used a 410 f flat iron to straighten my hair during the process frizz nada i mean this is awesome i dont know how long this is gonna last but i live in a pretty humid city 60 70 humidity and my hair is holding up pretty well texture now this is what bummed me i dont know if this is the heat damage due to obsessively trying to striaghten out the kinks or me skipping the argan oil i just used my redken heat protectant the texture of my hair seemed a bit rougher than usual smell i did not see any smell post wash my hair smells like my shampoo organix keratin shampoo so far i am impressed and i will update on the longevity of the treatment the only con so far is the 48 hour wait period with a smelly hair 
2014-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i read all of the reviews positive and negative and they were very helpful i did not expect for my hair to be straight without blow drying and flat ironing it s not quot naturally straight quot due to the treatment it is however noticeably easier to blow out and flat iron the improvement in frizz is huge i ve always struggled with frizz especially in the summer and this product is so helpful i can tell you that if you live at the beach it might not hold up to beach humidity the first week after i did the treatment i was at the beach and my hair stayed relatively frizz free when it wasn t super humid but did frizz up when it was very humid that s why i didn t give it 5 lippies but maybe i m expecting too much when i got back home dc suburb i was thrilled it s very humid here in the summer and my hair has been looking really good it s been 3 weeks and it s looking just as good as when i first did the treatment i do wash my hair every other day for the most part so maybe that helps with staying power i m using sulfate free products both organix and also loreal oleo therapy shampoos and conditioners regarding the application i took the advice of some reviewers and was careful not to oversaturate my hair with the treatment i applied it as i would a leave in conditioner i have armpit length hair and a lot of it and i d say i used half of the treatment which is great because now i have a second application can t beat that for a grand total of 15 as to the smell of the treatment it is not pretty but it s not too terrible i d say slightly more than medium stinky i used my karmin tourmaline flat iron which goes up to 450 degrees i would say i did 5 or 6 passes with iron for each section of hair not 7 10 as the directions specify just my preference at the time and it worked out fine all in all the entire treatment from shampoo to finishing flat ironing took me just over an hour i ve been blowing out and flat ironing my hair for years so maybe that helped i was very strict about waiting the 48 hours to shampoo and ended up waiting an extra 10 hours or so waited till the morning after the 48 hours were up my hair looked semi decent after 48 hours but was not presentable by the next morning it felt great to shampoo it all in all i am very happy with the results of this product i ve recommended it to friends and will use it again my hair feels and looks great and it s so nice to go out and come back home and my hair still looks good despite the humidity 
2013-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|absolutely love this product to be honest after reading reviews about the horrible smell leaving hair greasy and how difficult it is to apply i almost decided not to use it but i did pay for it so i decided to try it myself i am so glad i did because it is amazing i think those that had problems with greasy nasty hair and toxic smell used way too much of the straightening product also you have to be sure your hair is towel dried with no dripping i treated this product as i would a leave in conditioner i used sparingly since i knew i wouldn t be washing it out i made sure i used enough to coat it and of course combed it through really well i combed it the entire 30 minutes of the leave in time then i blow dried it and used the flat iron no hassle whatsoever it was super easy to use easier than coloring products pretty much like a styling product or a leave in conditioner fyi i hispanic my hair is dark long with a bit of wave and a little damaged i bought it to defrizz and tame it the fly aways and frizz have just been awful this product made it look just like the girl on the box no more friz no more fly aways just straight sleek and gorgeous i will definitely buy it again 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|after i moved down south i immediately began struggling with the humidity and the constant frizzy state of my normally tame hair i tried a few moisturizing serums and conditioners and nothing tamed the frizz so i bought this product however i was not interested in having straight hair just frizz free i straightened my hair according to the directions waited a day and then used a flat iron on braids and twists in order to regain my waves after washing my hair around the 40 hour mark and applying an anti frizz serum my hair was good to go wavy shiny and frizz less however i do not dye or use heat on my hair so those who do might have more unruly results 
2013-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|so i have never been happy with my curls not since the 90 s anyway i read the reviews and thought i would still try this i was really ok with having waves left not pin straight well i did this about 4 months ago and my hair is still a big mess of course i want my curls back no such luck my hair now looks sort of like i have a really bad perm waves here straight there and my curls are underneath obviously missed the underside of my hair when i applied i dont know how long it will be until the curls come back i may have to relayer and just cut out the damage i will not recommend nor repurchase 
2013-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|about two years ago i finally decided to do something about my unruly frizz ball hair after doing extensive research ie i went online and read a bit i went to a very fashionable ie expensive with loud music salon and got a keratin treatment to say i loved the results is an understatement my hair was soft manageable and i could actually straighten it with my trust chi in less than 30 minutes i felt like i solved the riddle of the sphinx well at least the riddle to my mop of tangled frizzy curls which is just as noteworthy in my book over the next 18 months or so i found a more reasonably priced salon and got three more treatments cut to today i m just starting out at a new job and my finances are those of a pauper yes i have money for food shelter and the occasional beauty product splurge but my hair looks awful the frizz is back with a vengeance it takes 45 minutes to straighten this mess i jokingly call my hair and the curl comes back within a day because my hair has has decided to show me who is really in charge i was at my wit s end and then i found out that a few companies have at home keratin treatments i was hesitant to even try this because i ve had terrible experiences with at home kits that take even a small amount of savvy to apply i decided to take a chance because i honestly couldn t stand looking at my frizzy head any longer included in this kit is a clarifying shampoo gloves and a ample amount of keratin you wash your hair apply the keratin wait 30 minutes and then flat iron your hair to seal in the keratin easy peasy right well yeah kind of i followed the instructions and even went the extra mile to pile my keratin soaked hair into a shower cap because that s what the salon folks did but i didn t exactly get salon results at the salon the stylists generally brush on the keratin mixture in very small amounts to very small sections of your hair it takes f o r e v e r and frankly i m just not that patient or adept i tried to ensure all my hair was coated and i paid special attention to my problem area the top of my head mainly and while i felt like i did a decent application job my hair was still a bit difficult to straighten it help to eliminate the frizz on my crown that will not budge but the hair near my scalp was still wavy despite several passes from my burning hot chi perhaps my chi doesn t get hot enough the keratin isn t strong enough or my application technique sucks but i couldn t duplicate the results i got at the salon no matter how hard i tried i also felt like this left my hair feeling filmy and oddly weighed down it wasn t dried out but it didn t feel super soft or particularly manageable this filmy feeling left when i was able to wash my hair again but having slightly icky feeling hair for three days was hard to adjust to i also didn t find that this lasts 30 days my hair reverted back to its original frizzy state with 15 to 20 days despite the fact that i wash my hair every four days or so on the plus side there s more than enough product in the kit to use this more than once my hair is past my shoulders and pretty fine but i have oddles of it and i still managed to get my hair pretty well coated and still have enough left for two more uses your mileage my vary overall i got decent results with this kit i can t swipe my chi through my hair on the first go round and get it to straighten and stay straight for days on end like i can when i get this done professionally but it does knock out some of the frizz and makes my hair a bit easier to deal with so would i recommend this at home kit instead of going to a salon no if you have the money get the keratin treatment done professionally because it s well worth the time and money and a whole lot easier to pay someone to painstakingly brush your strands with keratin than for you to do it yourself i would however recommend this to anyone who needs to tide them over until they can get to a salon i think this does help with the frizz factor but it doesn t really do much beyond that i also think this is reasonably priced considering that most salons charge 100 for keratin treatments especially if you can get more than one use out of one kit 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i love this product i had previously chemically straightened my hair 5 times yearly once before using this product so i needed control over my virgin hair and after reading other reviews i assumed it wouldn t actually work but give it a try anyway i loved the results my hair is partly wavy but frizzy and this product straightened my hair to natural straightness but not to an extent of chemical treatment i followed instructions as in the box and washed my hair after 48 hrs i love the feel of my hair the bounce softness and shine looks so much more healthier i would definitely re buy based on how long the product lasts on me 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i totally agree with other reviewers that this product will not make your hair pin straight i bought it to tame my frizzy lifeless perm damaged hair and it worked i just left it on for 48 hours and wash conditiong with shampoo and conditioner from the same line my hair is still wavy but super glossy and shiny and is exactly what i wanted sort of like old hollywood glam wavy hair if you know what i m talking about my hair is fairly long mid back and is full one bottle will last 2 treatments which is a good bargan my tip is that always wear gloves and never put on the treatment with bare hands i forgot to put on gloves on my 2nd try and my hands feel so rough now i gave it 4 stars because you need to bear with greasy hair and can t tie it for 48 hours but overall it s a great product and i ll continue using it 
2013-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i just put this in my hair earlier this morning and so far no problems the clarifying shampoo is awesome it smelled so good i don t know what some other people meant when they said the shampoo had a stringy texture because it was not stringy at all for me it was kind of thin which wasn t a problem at all because it lathers up really well after letting my hair dry 80 which just means it s mostly done drying but slightly damp i then applied the treatment to 2inch sections of hair make sure not to just glob it on otherwise it will be oily it even states not to over saturate hair after applying i blow dried hair and straightened my hair my hair looked amazing after straightening it my hair has never been so sleek after using a flat iron my sister even commented on my hair and now she wants to try this product after i see what my hair is like in 48 hours or so i will update this review so it has already been 48 hours later and i ve washed my hair with renpure moroccan argan oil shampoo and conditioner and then blow dried my hair the products okay but like the package says results may vary my hair is slightly wavy near the ends but otherwise it s decently straight it was actually easier to comb my hair after getting a shower because i usually have tangles everywhere and my hair is softer and more moisturized overall i probably would not buy this again if i wanted my hair to be slick straight i have about half of this left over maybe if i do it again my hair may become straighter if you do it continually over time hair may remain straighter who knows 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i m mixed asian black and am transitioning from a relaxer i have 7 months of new growth with probably a 3c texture in the crown i just did this treatment tonight this was the second time i ve tried this the first time i got the gross greasy hair that a lot of the negative reviewers had this time i used way less product i used a hair dye applicator brush and made sure the strands were coated but not over saturated that is the key i blow dried with a comb attachment and then flat ironed at about 410 degrees my hair is light and airy feels stronger and silky i can feel slight product but i m not worried about lint getting stuck to my hair will update after my tuesday night wash out 
2013-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i followed directions to a t except my straightener is ceramic and only goes to 410 instead of 450 if you research keratin treatments you need a titanium plated straightener that heats to 450 the titanium doesn t absorb the product but rather seals it into your hair and i still had amazing results keep in mind i otherwise have virgin hair and it is only wavy not super curly or course i did this to control frizz the only con is that my hair has less wave even after product wears off y i gave 4 lippies instead of 5 i ll be rebuying 
2013-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i am really disappointed with the whole organix line i had such high hopes for all of the shampoos conditioners and treatments it has been a huge let down since using the line my hair actually feels less moisturized greasy stringy and heavy i have not yet seen my hair have a unique shine or feel silky smooth very disappointed 
2013-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i had high hopes for this product i usually pay upwards of 300 bucks for a professional keratin treatment at the salon they ve always done wonders for my hair i saw this and thought i could save a boatload of money how hard could it be i followed the directions to a quot t quot everything went well my hair is very porous like a sponge so it sucks up product quickly i may have used a little more than i was supposed to but not so bad since i had a lot left over my hair looked great when i finished looked and felt just like the salon i was impressed i m a pro at waiting the 48 hours and no bending or tucking behind ears well on the 36th hour i woke up to a head of hair that looked and felt like i soaked it in a vat of crisco horrible my hair is usually sahara desert dry i could not go into work looking like that so i washed it out a few hours before after blowdrying my hair puffed and frizzed like it always had before a keratin treatments i will try it again it did leave my hair silky and soft but very frizzy i have enough for a second go around and i will make sure i don t leave my house until the 48th hour is up that will make my final decision for me 
2013-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|so i decided to give this a try since i had so much new growth and i wanted to wait until absolutely need to have a relaxer again but i couldn t take how thick my hair was i brought it at wal mart and put it the other night and omg all i can say is that i love this after i put the treatment in my hair and blow dried and flat ironed it my hair was so soft and smooth and shiny i had no problems with this treatment though i only used half of the bottle the treatment came in so now i have enough to do another one but i will definitely be buying this again my hair is so smooth and straight 
2012-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i was totally disappointed on this product it did nothing to my curly hair nothing i followed the instructions that as others said are not very clear what do they mean with 80 dry well i waited the 48 hours without bending or anything and it didn t work also your hair looks gross during that period of time it s greasy and weighed down i gave the product 2 lippies because it did repaired my hair and made it shiny and because for a keratin treatment is dirt cheap and very easy to use also it didn t damaged the color of my hair blonde i m stubborn and today i m trying it again for 24 hours let s see what happens 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i am reviewing the 14 day treatment the product comes in spray form first of all my hair is wavy coarse and tends to frizz very easy my hair is shoulder length and colored honey kissed blonde i followed the directions but probably put too much product on my hair because for the 48 hour wait my hair felt very dirty heavy after shampooing with everstraight shampoo then blowdrying my hair had not responded to the treatment very well not straightened but seemed softer 
2012-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|if you re looking for a product to give you stick straight hair this isn t going to do it i m afraid this product is however a good intensive conditioning treatment i colored my hair with l oreal preference towel dried and then applied this treatment i poured some into a dish dipped a fine tooth comb into it and applied it section by section the fine tooth comb helps to make sure you don t apply too much followed the directions blow dry flat iron for forty five minutes left on for 48 hours and my hair is so soft and smooth my two biggest tips use the fine tooth comb to apply because when you comb it through the comb will catch the excess and no matter how hard it is wait the full forty eight hours i ve waited 36 hours in the past but the results weren t as good yeah your hair will feel really dirty by the second day but it is so worth the wait 
2012-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|this is my lifesaver i seriously can t tell you how amazing this is i first bought this because of the soothing scent it had i automatically knew it wouldn t quot straighten quot my hair but it was worth a shot after the first wash i knew it had done great things i just ran out of my first shampoo and conditioner bottles today it lasts forever my hair is so strong and my natural waves are gorgeous this had made my hair managable soft silky strong and shiny without residue this is the only product i will ever use now thanks organix 
2012-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i love this product as i had very bad hair breakage and was told i need to cut all my hair off to regrow new hair i was referred to a company called grm celebrity wig warehouse spoke with the owner and told her my ordeal and she told me about using s full lace wig and they even applied the organix brazalian to my full lace wig due to me ordering a yaki straight texture for african american hair it made the the hair soooo bouncy and full of body when she sent it very beautiful i go the hair unit with the organix treatment in 24 inches so it was very long and full of body i recommend this product definitely to anyone and also i recommend anyone to order through her company and let her put the treatment in the hair for you it is done professionally and has last for a little over a month i also use sulfate free shampoo conditioner whenever i wash it did not have to wash it for 2 weeks though after her company added the treatment due to being so full of body and soft get this product it works or better yet order from the grm celebrity wig warehouse 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|the smell gave me a headache for two days plus it damage my hair 
2012-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|okay so you may be wondering why i gave this such low reviews and then say i want to buy it again the reason is simple it doesn t do what it claims to do but i love the product so my hair naturally really wavy culy and kind of dry on the ends so i used the serum and shampoo and conditioner in hopes that it would help straighten out my crazy locks it doesn t do that cat out of the bag oh well i ll live the shampoo is a really strange consistency almost mucusy weird it super thick and if i put it in my hand before applying it to my hair half of it slops out before it even gets into my hair it doesn t spread well either if i apply it to my scalp it wont reach the ends of my hair it smelled really good though i mixed it with some water and now after i do my regular shampoo i ll apply a little along my hair line for that wonderful coconut aroma the conditioner is a little too light for my taste my hair needs a very thick conditioner to satisfy my thirsty hair so not using those two products ever again plus they were pretty expensive but then i tried the serum omg so if i m planning on straightening my hair at least once a week i always blow dry it before hand it looks more more healthy and vibrant versus straightening after it has dried curly the only problem with this method of blow dry before straighten is that if i m planning to go out right after my hair is kind of frizzy solution do this before i go to bed and i ll wake up less frizzy but when i use this serum i don t need to wait a few hours for my hair to settle it looks shiny and smooth from the get go it also smells super good and feels warm and smooth in my hands only complaint in the packaging while it looks beautiful with the bronze gold colors and is eco friendly a nice little plus it s not a pump applicator for the serum and it drips down the sides of the bottle ugh so then i have to apply it in my hair and then wash the bottle off every time i use it so annoying after using it almost everyday that s another point i use this everyday on the tips of my hair to prevent them from looking too dry i love this serum and would definitely buy again just not as a quot straightening product quot 
2012-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|update 3 one year later one year i m not updating this review becuase i ve been using the product for one year i m updating because it s been a year since i put this product in my hair and the volume and curls are still gone from that one application in may of 2012 the good well that was a bargain for certain and it s still controling volume i don t know why my hair took to this as well as it did the regrowth is curling again at the top but it s not too bad the bad the ends when i don t take the time to flat iron are a mess i actually can not leave the house without straigtening or it looks shaggy and ragged some mousse will tame that but the curls have not come back at all so this has the potential to permanently change the texture of your hair update 2 this is advertised as a 30 day treatment well almost a month in my hair has completely lost any remnants of curl and is barely even wavy and that s straight out of th shower with no blow out it s also a fraction of the volume i was expecting to have to redo this at the end of june but it looks like i may be good for at least another month as the results for me at least seem to be getting progressively better flatter shine is good and looks healthy i have also just colored and it has not affected the results i m bumping up to a 5 update after a night of sleeping on it literally i woke up and while my hair was messy it was still tame in the sense of no frizz and the volume was the same as when i went to bed i will absolutely use this all summer long to control my hair the hair my hair is thick curly and tends to frizz summer is especially painful essentially my hair has been the bane of my existence since as long as i can remember my whole life the women who have oohed and aahed over my thick curls don t know what it s like on any given day to deal with the brillo pad sheep rhododendrun bush this type of hair can become the worst part is that it just never looks professional so i always have to wear it up in a school marm bun well i fixed that and chopped it all off it s now about 2 inches below my ears was down the middle of back frizzy curls be d mned so i thought with a way more manageable length i d give this treatment a try the goal i in no way expected this product to give me pin straight hair anyone looking for this from a seventeen dollar product should probably level set their expectations i was looking for a way to decrease frizz and volume from the curls the curls themselves start out ok but with each passing hour during the day my hair just gets bigger and bigger and bigger i wanted to tame the follicle mushroom cloud the process all the other ladies said three hours that s what it took i clarified twice as recommended for my hair type added the treatment and let set a couple of things kind of stumped me first you re supposed to towel dry hair to 80 dry uhm ok what s that so i took a guess and hoped it wasn t too damp too dry to take treatment properly next kind of what gives moment was the oversaturation everyone talks about again i took a guess and went for about the same level as when you at home color your hair the blow out took forever and i really don t think it s because i overdid it but i knew what i was in for so just patiently stuck with it it still felt damp no matter how long i attacked it but that s because the product is still on your hair so you do feel residue ladies if you have a cool setting on your blow dryer get used to it with this blowout after about 45 minutes i decided i was done and got out the flat iron watch your fingers your hair will burn you 450 degrees is hot that took about another 40 minutes good news was my hair really took to the treatment during the 48 hour waiting period and looked really healthy and great the smell i m pretty olfactory sensitive i feel like i spend half my life saying to people quot i can t believe you don t smell that quot i was prepared for toxic and barely smelled anything even when i was blowing out and flat ironing it was hardly anything one thing i did notice was little yellow flakes of product on my lap after the blow out phase the result today was the first wash and i didn t do anything with it i just let nature take its course because i wanted to see what would happen to the curls and it did curl even while i was still in the shower it started curl up after putting in a little mousse i ran my finger through it to stretch out the curls and not only are they more relaxed but my hair is the same size at 5 20 as it was at 8 30 it s a rainy day too which i wanted to test out not bad it has taken down the frizz and controlled the volume considerably the curl is loose and more of a nice wave and i am pleased with the result i m sure blown out or flat ironed it will be great overall i am satisfied and will bump my rating from a 3 to higher after a real humid day

2012-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i have very thin very fine hair it breaks easily and causes frizz and flyaways i have to wash my hair every day therefore i blowdry and straighten every day my hair is also coloured loreal castings in brownie semi permanant i have been looking for a product to reduce the broken flyaways which had become out of control i bought this as a stop gap until i had another product delivered it was 30 at priceline in australia after reading the reviews i was almost too scared to try this product but i m so glad i did you hardly use any this may be where people are going wrong i used perhaps 1 16th of the bottle if that also as my hair is incredibly thin so i only left the product on for 36 hours when i strainghtened my hair with the product on it looked heavy but smooth and the straightest i have ever seen the smell is nice and i imagine only over whelming if you have used far too much after washing it out i d say my frizziness and flyways have reduced by at least 50 this is not a straightening product and dont expect miracles it is simply designed to relax your hair and therefore smooth it i ve been really pleased with the results and no stripping of my colour will definately be using again 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|this left my hair slightly gummy but fairly straight and i thought quot ok this is not so bad quot then it proceeded to turn my salon highlights the most horrible orangey brassy reddish mess ever and when i went back to get them corrective my stylish couldn t believe how damaged my hair was in fact she asked me quot what have you been doing quot needless to say i will not be using this again john frieda s 3 day straight is a much better option 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i was looking forward to using this i ve followed the directions carefully the only thing is my flat iron only heats up to 425 on both 1 inch plates so that probably expalns i avoid getting my hair wet and did not use ponytails berettes etc which i was glad that the treatment had heat protection i went around in public with my hair stick straight and smelling like coconut cookies when i had it in my hair for 48 hours i wash it with the organix shampoos and conditioner and blow dried it then nothing it did absolutly nothing to my kinky curly hair though the smell of the product was wonderful but i was ever disapointed i should of saved my money 
2012-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|using this stuff requires a great effort for mediocre results i waited out the requisite two days with limp smelly flat hair only to wash it out and find my hair s texture only slightly improved at the expense of its colour but i m really compelled to write this because i ve just read that the manufacturer has been taken to task for misrepresenting the product as formaldehyde free tests show it does indeed contain this nasty so best stay well clear of it i think if you live in australia you can even get a refund even though traces of formaldehyde may be present unlabelled in lots of products i think this product deserves a dishonourable mention for dodgy ingredient listing and outright falsehoods http www accc gov au content index phtml itemid 1020988
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i was so happy to find this thinking i wouldn t have to pay 500 to get the treatment in salon but was i ever disappointed it did absolutely nothing to tame my unruly curl and what s worse is that i had to spend two days avoiding water like the plague and sleeping awkwardly to prevent my hair from developing kinks all in vain not to mention the waste of a perfectly usable 30 bucks though i would never recommend this product at any price until i can afford to get the treatment done professionally the flat iron though brutally damaging is my only saviour 
2011-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i had high hopes this would work for me i have unevenly wavy hair that is very thick so i wanted to make it more manageable and hopefully be able to let it air dry i followed directions however my iron only went up to 400 and it has ceramic plates i have a suspicion that this simply won t work well with the product and that s why i had a disappointing experience it lightened the dyed portion of my hair a few shades my hair also feels very dry which is a shame because i felt as though it had finally healed from the dying i stopped a few months ago the smell was pretty bad but mostly because i got sick of it at least it smells kind of like perfume so i hope i didn t bother anyone at work during the 2 days i had it in i never thought i would make the 2 days without washing but i did the second day isn t as bad as you might imagine the straightening results my hair dries the same way it always did disappointing however it dries faster with my blow dryer and there are slightly less kinks when i flat iron i do find that my hair is now more impressionable for example if i pin my bangs up and i want them back down i have to strait iron them or else they will want to stand up same goes for putting my hair in a pony or tucking hair behind my ears it s very inconvenient and i sort of miss my flowy hair bottom line it did lighten my dark hair didn t affect my natural hair texture made my hair want to mold to everything and dried out amp damaged my ends however it is faster to blow dry and i find it lays flatter after i flat iron worth it not at all i miss my flowy hair i hope my hair is back to normal by the end of the month give this a shot if you re desperate but make sure the tools you use are compatible and do a strand test if your hair is dyed 
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|alert epic fail do not buy if you have colored hair very curly frizzy hair and i color it every 3 weeks mostly to cover the grey hair do not use this product if you have blond colored hair it says it s okay to color if you have blond hair on the box and since i got it at ulta in a bogo promotion bought the organix morrocan oil that s another story it turned my hair orange orange brassy poker stiff brillo pad to the point i could not even get a large tooth comb or brush thru it and to make matters worse it did absolutely nothing to straighten my hair or de frizz it l another loser defrizzing product honestly have used them all and the only thing that ever worked was an 800 japanese thermal straightening treatment i got 9 years ago of course i had just moved to florida and got a windfall and decided to splurge but the quot grow in quot treatments would have cost 300 a session and could not afford to keep it up right now using paul mitchell skinny serum which doesn t straighten it either but helps a little bit with the straightening iron and doesn t leave hair damaged 
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i had high hopes for this product and i have to say it did condition my hair it also lightened it a bit and now 3 weeks later i can see tons of strands of hair broken off about an inch from my scalp i have very heathy strong hair so this is quite a surprise i would not repurchase this product nor would i recommend it 
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|so far i m liking this kit as of right now i m letting it sit in my hair until 10 30 then i have to blowdry and flat iron it but as of now i will give this 3 lippies because everything seems to be going well i will update this review after i have blowdried and flat ironed my hair and also after i wash it out in two days ps i don t know what you people are talking about but the smell of this is amazing it smells all coconutty and i love coconut smells so maybe that s why lol if you hate coconut smells this product will drive you nuts update 1 25 2012 i m now dropping this to a one lippie rating because this did nothing for my hair except dry it out my hair looks just like it did before the treatment except my ends feel like brillo i even conditioned my hair for 10 mins and that still didn t help i have 3 4 s of this product left and i have no idea what i m going to do with the rest of this s basically i m not happy i would not recommend 
2011-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|ok so first things first some of the reviews on here are for the shampoo conditioner or other products in the range this is for the 30 day smooth treatment secondly unlike others i did follow the full guidance for this treatment most importantly i used a straightening iron that actually went up to the specified temperature my hair is a mixture of 2b and 2c curls with normal porosity and normal elasticity medium coarse texture it is just past jaw length just above shoulder i have had 2 bkts in the past but they are no longer in my hair i blow dry and straighten my hair regularly i bought this product on a whim and did not expect it to give me full salon results however did expect more i washed and clarified with the provided shampoo then left my hair to dry til 80 dry the product is 100ml however you don t need the full bottle to ensure i got a really smooth even coating on my hair without applying too much product i applied it by dipping a very fine tooth comb into the solution wiping off some of the excess and then combing it from root to tip through my hair this method allowed for each strand to be lightly coated however any excess came off on the comb using this method i used just over half the bottle i then blow dried and straightened running the iron through small sections at least 8 times people have complained about the smell i noticed a chocolatey cocoa smell and a lot of steam coming off when i was doing it my hair got so hot that i could not touch each section with bare hands after running the iron over it i used the babylis curl and straight on full power 230 c 445 f once the ironing was finished i was left with heavy coated hair then began the torture of the 48 hour wait my hair didn t look really greasy however it definitely did not look clean at all i avoided getting my hair wet and made sure i ran over it with the irons after sleeping to get any kinks out i think that the feeling is partly because it is top heavy with cocoa butter and the result well after 48 hours i was desperate to get the evil gunk out of my hair after washing it out with a sulfate free and sodium chloride free shampoo and conditioner kirkland hydrating i towel dried at this point i would say that about 80 of my curl was gone however 0 of the frizz was gone the manufacturers state that it cuts drying time by 75 however i have not even noticed that it has cut it down by 5 i have waited another week before writing this review to see how i get on with it and have to say i am not impressed whilst i never expected it to be the same result as a salon bkt i am disappointed that it has taken out my curl but left me with frizz i would have preferred to have had curl but less frizz wouldn t we all i still spend the same length of time drying and flat ironing and haven t noticed any benefits at all finally the overall condition and texture of my hair has not been improved at all in fact i would say that i have had an increase in damage split ends and dryness 
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|this is by far the worst product i have ever used to control my friz prone hair i am a true supporter of liquid keratin but i fell for this product because it was so cheap at cvs how stupid now i know why it was so cheap it smells cheap like coconut and it looked like mayonaise on my hair horrible i could hardly get it dry while my hair was totally butter it was sooo fat really gross after blow drying and using my iron it was hot and fat the next morning my hair was full with a sort of rubber daindruff and fat and even wavy instead of straight after 36 hours i washed it out never felt worse with my greasy hair after washing my hair with the shampoo and conditioner of the same brand which smelled cheap of coconut again it was as coarse and frizzy as it never was no straight soft hair but instead the most awful hair i ever had the next day after washing still worse i used liquid keratin again and immediately my hair was soft and straight again never use this awful product again i threw it all away 
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|if you have colour treated hair do not use this product not only was the product a waste of time and money but it cost me much more because i had to get my hair recoloured after there is no warning on the packaging or the directions on the bottle despite the company insisting that there is after contacting organix vogue international the customer service is among the poorest i have experienced i told them that my coloured hair had turned an unnatural shade after following the instructions and i had to wash it out after 18 hours they pretty much told me quot sorry you feel that way and our directions on the packaging and bottle indicate to do a strand test quot not true if you read the packaging and bottle directions they indicate no such thing in fact the opposite it says quot safe on colour treated hair quot when i scanned the packaging and directions and emailed them again as proof they didn t even bother to respond bad product bad customer service 
2011-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i feel like i owe this product a good review i was skeptical to buy it based on the mixed reviews but i figured i had nothing to loose because my hair cant become more of a mess than it already was after trying it bottom line it has done absolute wonders for my hair background my hair type texture brown long course wavy ish frizzy and straight near the roots i have light blonde highlights that i did with an at home kit i needed hair to be manageable i have no problem with my natural wavy texture the thing i hate is that it takes 45 mins to straighten curl or get it to look half way decent because it s just so darn poufy i followed the directions on the packaging exactly so i m not going to explain that here if you can read this review chances are you can read directions flat iron used fahrenheit titanium 30 at marshall s ross tj maxx you need a flat iron that a goes up to 450 degrees f essential to seal in the keratin to the hair shaft and b has titanium plates ceramic plates will absorb the keratin product out of your hair the chi will not work now my hair is soft soooo much more manageable and the frizz gone i can let it airdry with zero product and there is no poof whatsoever it now takes 10 minutes to flat iron yes just 10 minutes my highlights did change to a darker kind of caramel color which i actually kind of like bottom line do your research follow the directions and don t expect your hair to become stick straight i think most people had problems because they didn t follow the directions or they didn t research to find the right tools also this is a keratin treatment to rebuild your hair s structure and make it easier to manage not to change it if you want stick straight hair you need to get the japanese chemical straightening treatment i would defiantly reccoment this product to anyone looking to just tame their crazy hair down a bit 
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|please do not buy this product i have read the reviews on it after i bought it so i proceeded to use it although some reviewers did say it will ruin the haircolour well it did ruin my newly coloured haircolour it turned awful red this was the biggest waste of money and time it also ruined the texture of my hair in addition to colour the hair is very thin now please please do not buy use this i can only hope my hair will go back to normal with time 
2011-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|this is a great product if you want soft manageable curls my curls reduced a little bit and after my shower i didn t have to put a bunch of junk in my hair to control the frizz and curls and i loved that do not use this product if you are expecting to have completely straight hair it will make your curls a little softer but it does not make your hair completely straight i think this product is best for those who want manageable wavy hair oh and i would definitely recommend following the instructions completely 
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|long time user of this forum first time reviewer i felt compelled to write a review after i used this product as it was so disappointing i have used a number of products from this brand and am generally really happy with them their shampoos and conditioners are the best however this product was a complete waste of my time and money i have very fine wavy curly hair which tends to frizz on top and at the front i once paid 100 for a professional chemical straighten with amazing results i was only at the hair dresser for about an hour and she did not even need to straighten my hair with tongs i thought this product would have a smilar result but it did absolutely nothing admittedly my hair does feel a little softer but this is not why i bought the product there is no reduction in curl or frizziness the product cost me about 30 aus which is not a lot compared to some products but quite a lot for something with no results plus for two days my hair felt quite greasy and i could not go to the gym or tie up my hair so it was quite inconvenient this is nothing but a time consuming over priced treatment i get the same results from using kerastase oleo relax masque however the masque costs the same amount and last for a year and i only have to leave it in my hair for 10 minutes to get the same result sorry organix stick to the shampoos and conditioners 
2011-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i read reviews for this and had my friend not tell me she loved it and swore by it i would have never tried it it has a lot of bad reviews hair color changig being the one that scared me the most the price is great and i applied it yesterday and my hair looks gorgeous my hair is thick wavy amp blonde i followed the directions perfectly and my result so far is gorgeous silky smooth straight hair it feels soft amp looks shiny and healthy i can wash my hair tomorrow night however i may wait an extra day if my hair keeps looking this great it doesn t have any greasy look or feel as of yet 24hrs after initial application i have blonde hair and have not had any discoloration at all also there is more than 1 application in there at least for my hair which is awesome he only thing i ll need to do is purchase a good clarifying shampoo to use on my hair before i apply it next time as the box has 1 application only of that shampoo j purchased the organix shampoo consitioner to use on a daily basis i will write another review after a few weeks to see how well this shiny smooth hair lasts for now i say definitely go out and buy this much cheaper than going to a salon and i think you will be impressed with all aspects of this product 
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i tried this product twice i did not follow the instructions properly the first time and as a result it did not work at all i decided to try it for the second time and i am extremely disappointed i followed the instruction correctly this time and yet i am sitting here with curly hair i am so mad 
2011-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|this review is for the ever straight braziliian keratin therapy 30 day soothing treatment so yesterday i got my mum im 13 btw to apply it on my blonde highlighted hair i was super scared that it would turn my hair into a disgusting red the application took approx 2 5 hours and was long but it was defenetly worth it im amazed by the results after 1 day usually after i starghten my hair and sleep on it there is a major kink amp let me tell you i have massive fly aways and lots of friz no i dont need to even brush it because its smooth silky amp amazing i did not oversaturate my mum followed the directions every cautiously now i have amazing hair which i hope will last the full month i do not know how people are complaining about the smell it smelled absolutely deliscious to me and my mum even when we were starightening i recommend this to people who arent afraid of a little colour change so prefably brunettes as it will chnge your colour if its colour treated do not overstaurate as this is the reason why people are complaining of greasy hair mine is absolutely perfect you should do the process in a room with a fan or opened window as the straightener does give out a lot of fumes i will upate in 1 week to see how my silk amazing hair is going this stuff is amazing 
2011-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|it s a great over the counter product it doesn t have major straightening power but it does smooth the hair like crazy it left my hair silky soft and with a lovely shiny sheen it kind of reminded me of garnier s perfect blow except the organix is better because it s a cream not a two step gel process also the organix does not stink at all it is odorless also i didn t use the clarifying shampoo because it makes my hair feel like straw i just put the smoothing treatment on my dry hair and it worked fantastic i will buy again i d rather use this than the garnier perfect blow i typically do the real bkt because i my hair straight with organix smoothing i think i can give up the bkt i usually wind up having to straighten my hair 2 3 times per week even after bkt treatment plus it makes my hair feel like straw update it s been a few washes and my hair is still soft so it does have some lasting power and like i said i didn t use the clarifying shampoo that stuff is just awful i always just toss it i m sure it s great for people with fine or oily hair update okay so i over processed my hair it was horrible i was about to cut it off because the last two inches of hair were unsightly and felt horribly i heard that bkt is good for damaged hair i figured i d give this stuff a shot and it worked cannot believe it my ends are super smooth just to be sure it wasn t a fluke i ve waited a month before using again in total it s been two months and though there is some sings of damage you wouldn t be able to tell organix bkt is pretty great stuff it has repaired my hair over 90 
2011-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|it was very basic it did the job but nothing special i was neither overly pleased or overly disappointed although i can find better if is either spend a bit more money or something just as good much cheaper
2011-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i love this stuff i m surprised it s getting such negative reviews here no it s not a miracle product but it does greatly reduce my drying flat ironing time and it makes my hair more manageable a lot of people on here have complained about greasy hair while using this your hair should not be greasy if it is you re using way too much i have extremely thick wavy hair and i ve used probably 1 2 of the container of product and i ve used it 4 times now you should not be using the whole container anyway here s what i do and i ve gotten great results 1 pre wash i ran out of the clarifying stuff that comes with the product but i ve had much better luck first using a more clarifying shampoo i use kerastase oleo relax then using a protein shampoo phytonectar and leaving that in my hair for about 20 minutes rinse that out and towel dry hair 2 apply product i use probably 4 quarter sized dollops for my entire head i keep it away from my roots and concentrate on the ends then i comb it through to make sure it s distributed 3 blow dry after 30 minutes per instructions i blow dry my hair as straight as i can get it make sure your hair is completely dry 4 flat iron this takes forever but it s worth it flat iron small sections of your hair i use clips so i can get at certain problem areas where it s extra wavy it s also super important to have a hand held mirror so you can see behind you my hair often feels straight when i touch it but when i actually look at it in the mirror it s still really wavy your hair will get hot but be sure to get it as straight as possible 5 wait yeah 48 hours is a long time and not a lot of fun but i find that my hair really doesn t look bad on day 2 it s a little flat but still looks decent i clip my bangs up as i m not really concerned about the product working on them i re flat iron in the morning of the second day and check throughout the day to make sure it s still straight this process works really well for me it s tedious but for 15 you can t really beat it prepare to spend a good 3 hours doing everything washing leaving it in drying ironing but that s not really any worse than doing it in a salon great results here will repurchase oh and don t even think of buying the organix s amp c that stuff is awful 
2011-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|im from australia so it cost me about 20 dollars for this since it was expensive i was expecting a lot more from it i have long brown hair with split ends etc its naturally wavy curly depending on how i let it dry i blow dry and straighten my hair every few days i used just enough to coat my hair and left it in overnight cause it was quite late in the morning i quickly blow dried it and straightened it and was very happy with the results my hair was so soft and silky and it was really shiny no problems with it being too oily when i decided to wash my hair which was a few days later i think i used herbal essence or pantene it was as if i never treated my hair i wouldnt mind trying it again and using shampoo and conditioner that is safe 
2011-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i knew i had to try this product regardless of the mixed reviews first of all anyone who tries this product should have a basic familiarity with keratin products and it probably helps if you ve had one professionally applied so you have an idea of what to do i am far from an expert on keratin hair products but i definitely did my research before getting a brazilian blowout in june which cost me over 400 with tip a keratin treatment is not for everyone it is very easy to quot overdose quot on protein if your hair already has enough protein a protein treatment will make your hair drier instead of moisturizing it if you are using a shampoo with protein while you are getting protein treatments that could make your hair drier as well yes the box says it s safe for color treated hair but it also says to do a strand test this is an over the counter 15 treatment you can t expect that it is going to give you pin straight hair ok i know the box shouldn t claim that it does and you really can t expect the same results as a 400 treatment done by a professional it is disappointing to see a lot of the reviews reflect that mentality my opinion on the formaldehyde claims products are legally allowed to say there are no quot hydes quot if it s lower than a certain percentage there are also other names they can go by is this right maybe not but it s legal and the small amount isn t going to kill you if you lead an all organic lifestyle this product probably isn t for you however chances are you ve probably come into contact with food that has worse chemicals or you ve been in the sun without sunscreen etcetc you are not going to find a product that can do life changing things to your hair without chemicals period now onto my experience i have virgin but incredibly dry hair it is not straight but not curly sort of like an undefined wave that i sometimes get compliments on and sometimes it just looks crazy there is an underlayer of unmanageable frizz in my hair no hair stylist i ve ever been to seems to understand it i have split ends all the time including right after i get a haircut i have pieces of thick hair and pieces of incredibly thin fine fragile hair that confuses people including me i pretty much never heat style it anymore but i straighten my bangs and little fly away pieces on the side every morning if i wash it put some sebastian potion 9 in it put it in a bun and let it air dry it usually looks pretty decent i got a bb in june of this year i spent a lot of time doing research and finding a reputable salon listed on bb s site that also had good reviews i was in love with my hair after i washed it the first time i had a very soft wave that gave my hair body but the frizz was essentially eliminated unfortunately this lasted a month max and cost me half a week s pay i used a sulfate free shampoo and i wash my hair very infrequently maybe 2x a week so i was expecting the results would last at least 3 months the minimum salons say i was on the fence about what to do the results were great but for such a short period of time i recently bought a groupon for 150 for my next one i ll have to tip about 70 because that s 20 of the original price so 220 for that one onto the product that i m reviewing i didn t really know what to expect i m currently traveling for work so my options were to do this in a small hotel room where i can t open any windows or wait until i m home in december i m impatient so i figured i d take my chances when i got my original bb done my eyes started tearing up even though there was a fan right next to me in a big open salon it wasn t anything intolerable but i did experience some sensitivity i like the shampoo that s included i do wish the packet was a little bit bigger because this bottle will last me at least 2 treatments so i had to make the shampoo last it smells great i followed the directions on the box and after my hair was quot about 80 dry quot i started to apply the product i noticed no sensitivity whatsoever i accidentally got some on the back of my neck but it didn t bother me about half way through i took the gloves off to try and get a better idea of how much product i had in my hair i applied some without gloves and had no issues i washed my hands thoroughly after i finished applying the product the only thing i think the directions should be more clear about is not to quot oversaturate quot the hair i also wish you could see through the bottle a little bit i had planned on using about half the bottle figuring that would be good for my almost elbow length hair my hair felt evenly coated but definitely wasn t oozing product next i blow dried and flat ironed my hair after waiting 20 30 min i didn t think the product smelled bad at all although extra smoke came off which is definitely normal for these types of treatments you should be flat ironing your hair repeatedly until your hair pretty much gets too hot to touch that is what makes the product penetrate right now my hair looks about the same as when i first got my 400 treatment back in june it feels a little heavier and not as soft but i can tell the frizz was dimished it does not look greasy but my hair never does and i may even leave the treatment in for more than 48 hours i am going to update after i wash my hair but so far i feel like this product has produced almost equal results to an alternative that is much more costly this bottle cost 16 with tax and i have a full treatment left so 8 for what i just did to my hair if this lasts through at least 2 washings i ll bump my rating to a 5 if i wash the product out and there is no change in my hair i ll bump it down to a 3 
2011-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i got this product yesterday at the drugstore i ve had the brazilian blowout before it got pulled from the market and i loved it too bad it was completely toxic anyways this claimed no formaldehyde but after reading reviews there must be some chemical that i have not reacted well to i did the procedure long but that was expected anyways something in it or i m coming down with a bug has made me feel really sick i was feeling so noxious that i had to take the afternoon off work and wash it out i can still smell it though after 20 hours of keeping it in i can tell the curl is softer and it s easier to blow dry i bet if i was able to handle the product and leave it in it would be great 
2011-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i ve had this box sitting in my bathroom for a while now and i just have gotten around to being able to use it seeing as how it is a process you have to follow the directions and like it says do not over saturate i think that s what i did and that s where i went wrong although i m still happy with the results so i did like the directions said and towel dried my hair and applied to small sections and let it sit for 30 minutes i think my hair was a little more than 80 wet and i put too much in my hair i was just afraid i wasn t going to have enough once i started blow drying is when i realized i had too much in it was sooooo oily and nasty feeling and i knew i wouldn t be able to handle 48 hours of it i did flat iron it like it said just because i didn t want to completely waste it i ended up leaving it on for about 3 hours before i decided to wash it out i have a big bottle of the ion keratin treatment so i figured i could always try again at a later time i used the l oreal eversleek shampoo since it is sulfate and silicone free like the box suggests i used the eversleek conditioner and left it in for about 10 15 minutes my hair felt sooooo nice when i washed everything out i can tell a difference in my hair even though i didn t follow the directions exactly i m letting it air dry and it s still somewhat wavy like it normally is but it still feels very smooth and there seems to be a lot less frizz i think this treatment would be great if the directions are followed i m thinking of picking up another box next time i go to walgreens and now i know not to use so much a little bit goes a loooong way but i would definitely recommend this to someone whose hair is in need of some serious help 
2011-08|4.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|i don t understand the extremely different reviews for this product i have fine curly hair that is color treated i found this product easy to use and it did not smell bad at all i think that some people are using the whole bottle and it says to not over saturate your hair hence the greasy look i combed the product thru for 30 minutes to keep the hair as straight as possible i also waited until my hair was damp not wet to apply it it did not take me two hours to do this process only about an hr from application to drying its a good product for 15 00 i wouldn t expect it to be as good as paying 300 00 at a salon and having a professional do it 
2011-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|this stuff is amazing although going 48 hours with this stuff in your hair was hell it smelled bad and made me break out im pretty sure i only had pimples bc i would go from touching my hair to touching my face not a good idea my hair is so much more manageable now it used to take me forever to do my hair i would blow dry with a round brush then flat iron itto tame the frizzy mess not anymore i let my hair air dry till its damp then just run a round brush through it with my hair dryer for 5 minutes and im out the door i would defly recommend this to anyone who wants a keratin treatment but cant afford the salon prices i will defly be doing this again in a month also my hair did change colors a little but nothing crazy like other peoples hair actually dont mind the color it came out 
2011-08|1.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|there s a lot of reasons why brazillian keratin treatments aren t found in stores like you d find colour or perm kits and the formaldehyde contained in them is one of those reasons which is how i imagine this product made it onto shelves in the first place however a lot of other factors play into the results you get with this so bear with me as far as the grueling details i d just like to add that yes i am a stylist but i m also very aware of basic biochemistry i m a member of naturallycurly and the long hair community and i have let myself lose money talking clients out of buying products that weren t ging to work for them this is a review written entirely for your safety and the quality of your hair firstly did you know that salt from water softeners the ocean and certain types of shampoos and conditioners even gentle ones like for example all of the lines you can purchase at tjs can ruin or at the very least tamper with the results of this type of bkt you probably didn t that s why salons prefer that you return to the salon to wash theirs out where they can control this much better or that the temperature of your flat iron during the process as well as how many times you pass it through the hair really is one of the most important parts your flat iron depending on it s quality probably isn t going to give results quite as accurate as most professional models i ve had a couple clients come in having issues with this product and come to find out they were using an iron that was 5 years old how about this osha allows formaldehyde to be labelled as any one of the following methylene glycol formalin methylene oxide paraform formic aldehyde methanal oxomethane oxymethylene or cas number 50 00 0 most of these products contain some sort of quot aldehyde quot like formaldehyde because of the similarities between the ways that keratin and formaldehyde bond as far as their molecular geometry quot aldehyde quot bonds are slightly cleaner thus stronger and shinier than keratin bonds that s exactly why they use it quot formaldehyde preserves or fixes tissue or cells by reversibly cross linking primary amino groups in proteins with other nearby nitrogen atoms in protein or dna through a ch2 linkage quot although i don t recommend these treatments in general i will say that the professional haircare industry has come out with one or two genuinely formaldehyde free bkt s within the past year so do your research find out what s safe and that s the way it s done 
2011-08|3.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|to all those saying there aren t any warnings about the color changing quot it is recommended that a strand test in a discreet area be performed prior to application especially if you have light colored or chemically treated hair in isolated circumstances some may experience a discoloration of the hair quot straight from their website http www organixhair com content bkt 30 day smoothing treatment instructions i m pretty sure it s on the box too but i d have to double check since i don t have the packaging sitting in front of me anyway to my review i ll have to update this since it hasn t even been a full 24 hours yet the process while easy was time consuming i have hair that is fairly fine but thick so it looks normal but really there s a lot of it i can t do a thing with it unless i spend an hour or more blow drying flat ironing or curling which i hate and rarely do otherwise it just kind does it s own thing it has a wave but it s not well defined it goes to about the back of my bra strap so decently long a lot of times i don t even brush it since that just makes it worse every once in a while i ll randomly get awesome sexy bed head hair but that s pretty rare i started kind of late at night and it took about 3 hours total and i know i way over saturated my hair by accident took forever to blow dry and now it feels a little on the icky side although my coworker says it looks perfectly fine i used my t3 hairdryer and my chi falt iron i think my chi only goes up to 350 but my hair is very straight at the moment but i am counting downt the hours until i can wash it in a couple of weeks when i have a better idea i ll update this review 
2011-08|2.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment|warrning stripped color from hair i had colored my hair a couple of weeks ago with garnier fructis herbashine 426 deep burgundy it was a very pretty dark shiny color before that i had a med chestnut color with light caramel highlights i decided to try this last night i washed my hair with the clarifying shampoo twice let it air dry for a bit then applied the straighting product all seemed well although i do think i may have used a bit much but i have long thick hair amp wanted to make sure to get it all covered when i started to blow dry it felt super coated amp waxy i thought i would never get it dry it did dry after awhile but felt so sticky amp gross i noticed then it looked a bit lighter i could see my old highlights a bit but nothing to drastic i thought maybe the clarifying shampoo removed some of the color then i started straighting it as soon as i did the first pass with the straightener i was shocked to see the coloring lighting right in front of my eyes it turned a light brassy color i almost ran in amp washed it out from my hair right then but i didn t know what to do i now had this one section of hair that was bone straight amp light amp the rest still curly amp dark after a lot of hand ringing i decided to finish the process its now the second day amp my hair is super straight but it feels so nasty i cant wait to wash it out all the dark color that was in my hair is gone its now back to the highlighted look but even lighter than it originally was amp brassy i will update after the first wash bit unless it does wonders for my curly frizzy hair i will never try it again 
2018-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Surge Treatment|i live by the mediterranean which means my dyed and generally tortured hair can get severely parched both because of the sea and the sun during summer this literally saved my hair at a time when i thought my would break into pieces because of dryness and the natural oils i was experimenting with at the time did not help but i used the whole tube on my coarse shoulder length hair and waited for two hours the result was happy hydrated rescued hair unfortunately it has a chemically swimming pool smell that probably got amplified when i used the whole tube it triggered my migraine which is not usually triggered by smells and that s the only reason why i will not purchase again otherwise it would be my hg moisturizing treatment 
2016-08|2.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Surge Treatment|i purchased this mainly for the scent and i was hoping this wouldn t be as waxy as the regular conditioners it did look to be a little creamier and not as thick and waxy as the regular sea mineral conditioner so i bought it however even using a pea sized amount on the ends of my fine wavy hair made it feel weighed down and gross i paired it with a cleansing shampoo prell and rinsed really well but my hair still felt coated yet it had surface frizz the scent is a beachy sea salt ocean smell it reminds me a little of the old revlon aqumarine which had been discontinued unfortunately this is just way too heavy for my hair it costs around 9 
2015-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Surge Treatment|i just wrote reviews for the shampoo and conditioner from this same organix line and about my disappointment with both products and organix in general unfortunately i have equally few good things to say about this deep conditioning treatment it smells great and it s definitely more conditioning than the regular conditioner in this same line of products i would not repurchase the regular conditioner again ever this one has almost exactly the same ingredients and in the 2 months i was interchanging this with the regular conditioner i noticed on washes with the deep conditioner my hair stayed moisturized and controlled better over the 2 3 days until the next wash unfortunately the sea mineral moisture line seems to promise to take care of split ends which it didn t for me if it weren t for this deep conditioner i think the split ends would have been worse and my strands would have been parched but i think the entire system overall has not worked out for me so i will be looking elsewhere for hair care that will help prevent split ends 
2015-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Surge Treatment|while i typically love the organix line the results of this hair treatment were pretty underwhelming it smells absolutely fantastic a refreshing aquatic spa like scent but it basically just felt like a normal conditioner i appreciate that it s a lightweight treatment that didn t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy and my hair did seem a little less frizzy unmanageable after i used it but it just doesn t have much of a rich luxurious moisturizing texture it definitely didn t do my hair any harm and the price was so reasonable that i don t regret buying it i think it was on sale for 5 99 at albertson s but it s literally a bit lackluster 
2015-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Surge Treatment|i m a fan of organix there has only been one product i didn t like this treatment is very moisturizing and makes my hair so soft and healthy looking i do think they have better scents than this one it does smell like the sea i also like that it s in a squeeze tube instead of a jar u dip fingers in organix doesn t have sulfates and i think it makes my hair look better when i use their line 
2015-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Surge Treatment|i m actually very fond of the organix sea mineral line i think all of the products smell wonderful and whenever i use the shampoo and conditioner my hair is tamed i have wavy frizzy hair and these products definitely helped with smoothing my locks i use this treatment when i want to give my hair some tlc it makes my hair so soft and helps enhance my natural shine 
2014-08|2.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Surge Treatment|this is the first organix product that failed to meet my expectations having loved the sea mineral shampoo and conditioner i thought i d give this a try since i ve been heat styling more often and my ends are a little dry after shampooing like normal i applied this from ear level down to my ends concentrating on the ends i left it in for about 10 minutes while i shaved my legs and scrubbed the rest of my body it isn t very thick at all and almost has the texture of just regular shampoo when i went to rinse it out it felt as though there wasn t even any product in my hair like i never applied this deep conditioner at all it was really odd after every use i really didn t notice any improvement in my hair it actually felt less hydrated than when i would use the regular sea mineral conditioner i say save your 6 and use it to purchase the regular sea mineral conditioner instead because that stuff is pretty awesome i saw some videos on youtube about this being good for co washing so perhaps it works well for that purpose but if you re looking for something to truly moisturize repair and deep condition this isn t it but on the bright side at least the smell is wonderful i m still a fan of organix but just not this particular product 
2018-08|3.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|i have thick but dyed and damaged hair it s an ok product which really softens my hair in the shower and for a day afterward but my brittle ends requires other products very quickly this doesn t cause build up or leave a film on my hair but neither have i had longer term or any visible benefits from its keratin my hair needs and likes lots of protein and redken really helps it has a musky smell 
2015-08|5.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|i m not sure why this worked for me but it makes my hair look healthier soft and shiny i don t use the product as directed because i have very fine hair and if it s over conditioned it weighs it down my hair is colour treated and i use a blowdryer and curling iron each time i style my hair so it s not the healthiest i wet my hair in the shower take about 1 tbsp or so of the keratin conditioner and distribute mainly through the ends lightly flowing it through with the tips of my fingers farther up the head i then shower i e wash shave etc then after about 5 10 minutes rinse the conditioner out and then shampoo my hair twice finishing with normal everyday conditioner my hair comes out softer and looks healthier i love the results and will repurchase edit forgot to mention i only do this about 1 2 times a week and not each time i wash my hair 
2015-08|4.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|okay this product was pretty nice i was looking for a protein treatment that was simple and easy to use at home that s what this is it s not a conditioner folks don t expect miracles from this if all you need is moisture my hair is fairly protein sensitive which means if i use too much or too often my hair would seem dry and brittle in fact i wouldn t use it at all except i recently went light blonde from pitch black dyed anyway i paid 10 can for this which is fair i think a little goes pretty far it s fairly liquid so it really gets at all your lengths smells okay smell doesn t last the packaging is good flip top and stands up easily so i can tell when my hair needs a little protein after a week or two it gets really soft like a little gummy feeling when wet i use a clarifying shampoo first make sure most of the water is squeezed out well and leave this in for 3 5 minutes rinse this really well the first time i used it i was surprised at how curly my 2b hair was after air drying the residue from not rinsing well enough left it a little crunchy weird but nice when rinsed out well i can tell my hair is strengthened and thickened even more body and waves i said i would purchase again and i would recommend it to people who need a bit of protein now and then but not to people who are looking for a deep conditioner that s not what this is hth
2015-08|2.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|i just used this for the first time and didn t get any result i had to do two treatments because my hair didn t even feel like it had been conditioned at all my normal conditioner would do a better job it smelt nice and looks nice on the plus side overall wouldn t buy this product again 
2014-08|4.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|i really like this stuff and do think it works i recently bleached my hair to remove old color and then treated with this for 30 minutes as a deep conditioner and it did really help a lot i thought it was really good for how much it cost and comparing it to other similar priced products of course this doesn t compare to macadamia oil so don t expect that and don t try to compare for 5 this is great stuff 
2014-08|5.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|i think i may be the only person who s found this stuff useful i have tape in hair extensions and as such they can get very dry and split at the ends this stuff has done more for my hair than coconut oil has i like the smell though there is definitely an underlying chemical smell there if you know what to look for overall i m very happy with the results it s brought will definitely use again i do however only use it on my ends as it would likely corrupt the taped bonds on my scalp and i don t need it there anyway 
2014-08|1.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|i really didnt like this i have very thick long hair and i had to use alot of this to lather good it did nothing to my hair the smell is ok but not strong enough for my taste and doesnt last longer than a few minutes i will never buy again 
2013-08|3.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|bought on sale used 5 times now to color treated waved hair doesn t feel like it conditions at all having to add conditioner after 
2013-08|3.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|i just bought this and used it i got it on sale in canada for 6 99 a decent price here it usually goes for 8 9 99 and thought it would be great for my recently damaged hair i am leary of keratin products and breakage but so far i like this product i wouldn t say it s amazing but for someone who doesn t want to wait for 20 30 minutes and two showers just to rinse out a hair mask this one works well for the shower 
2013-08|2.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|usually keratin really aids my wavy damaged hair this product did nothing for it less so than any other conditioner i ve used the packaging and smell was nice though 
2013-08|5.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|amo este producto deja mi cabello susve y muy brilloso
2013-08|3.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|i tried this treatment because my friend raved about it and said her hair had never been so smooth so i tried it and am not impressed it isn t thick and my hair doesn t even feel conditioned afterwards much less what i would expect after a conditioning treatment i do have curly somewhat damaged hair maybe my friends hair was just healthier to begin with and that why she got hg results 
2013-08|5.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil 3 Minute Miraculous Recovery|i really like this product the smell like most organix products is amazing i can t really describe it but it s so nice and lasts even after i have rinsed out the mask the consistency of it is watery and thin and i usually prefer a thicker cream because it makes me feel like my hair is being super saturated however it does coat the hair just make sure you wring your wet hair well to get as much water out as possible before you put it in after i rinse and let my hair dry it looks much smoother softer and shinier it s a noticeable difference and i would will repurchase 
2018-08|4.0|Smoothing + Shea Sleek Smooth Style Spray|yes this smells somewhat odd a bit like bug spray but it does help keep my straightened hair straight despite living in humid land i find it s excellent at taming any flyaways and also preventing frizz on all but the most excessive days of summer at 8 99 for 8oz ulta it s pretty good value too however it is very alcohol and artificial ingredients heavy so i try not to use it too often keeping just to special occasions or on days when i m not using bumble amp bumble s surf spray or thickening spray selena x my hg list as i ve sampled many 100s of skin hair and m u products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top 10 must have products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via e bay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora 1 hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil 2 lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm 3 pigmentation anti ageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum 4 cleanser paula s choice skin balancing cleanser 5 concealer mac studio finish concealer 6 lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash 7 foundation spf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow 8 face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream 9 moisturizer antipodes rejoice light day cream 10 hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment
2018-08|4.0|Smoothing + Shea Sleek Smooth Style Spray|i have bleach damaged hair and unless i use this my hair feels extremely dry and crunchy whenever i heat style it this actually makes my hair really soft adds movement and smooths it out the nozzle isn t the greatest though rather than evenly spraying the product it shoots in a direct spritz so i have to spray it into my hands first and then run it through my hair 
2018-08|5.0|Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine|i never really paid much attention to hair fallout as it is normal to lose some hairs every day that all changed when i found a bald spot one day while brushing my hair turns out i have an autoimmune disorder called alopecia areata for which i now receive injections directly into the bald spots to coax the follicles into growing hair i started checking out the rest of my hair and discovered some thinning around the hairline kind of like a receding hairline so started a search for hair products that might help and found the ogx fight fallout shampoo and conditioner i ve been using it for a couple of months now it doesn t do a thing for the alopecia areata but i wasn t expecting it to however i am noticing some tiny hairs growing along my hairline where the hair appeared to be receding i can t say for sure that these products are causing the regrowth but maybe they are the alopecia treatment is nowhere near the hairline the shampoo is very nice lathers fairly well and has a fresh minty smell which disappears quickly after rinsing the conditioner seems light weight and rinses well in the past i always just conditioned the ends but since the ingredients won t do any good on the ends i am now conditioning right up to the roots especially along the hairline with no greasy effects at all my hair feels soft and full after drying which is a bonus when i m worried about the bald spots showing some days i have used a different shampoo and i noticed my hair has less volume overall this is a great shampoo and it probably is helping with the fallout i ll keep purchasing 
2017-08|5.0|Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine|i have both the shampoo and the conditioner in this line but not the leave in treatment the leave in by my estimation seems to have many of the same ingredients that the pantene age defy and the clairol hair food equivalents had though the leave in for the organix might have saw palmetto extract so i may try it once i use up my hair food i bought the organix right after i d gotten a major haircut pre haircut my color treated hair which is fine frizzy and dry and hit around my shoulders was flat and shedding a lot i d be super annoyed washing my hair and seeing tons of long strands coming out i wasn t sure if it was the normal amount of shed though it seemed high to me especially since it was happening every time i shampooed or simply brushed my hair so i went and did a major chop kind of a pixie with more height at the crown with the new hair i thought i d try a new shampoo and see if i could revive my locks this product with the niacin and caffeine alpha hydroxy acids plus saw palmetto extract has ingredients that sound promising for boosting hair growth and reducing thinning and shedding sold i ve used it for about a month it s not a long enough time to really notice if i have new hair growth but i like what is happening the first time i used it in shower i wasn t super thrilled with the formula i didn t hate it but didn t love it either it lathers well but not super soapy the way some other shampoos can i don t mind that because i usually go for sulfate free formulas if i do the rinse and repeat trick it foams up more in round two however the formula smells faintly minty and there s a tiny bit of minty tingle on the scalp some other minty shampoos i ve tried in the past i ve hated because my hair would be dry and stripped feeling so i thought i would hate this but i don t i ve grown quite fond of it this doesn t leave my hair feeling stripped but it feels clean and not coated either the conditioner is mild it s also a tiny bit minty but it s not heavy in some fatty way it coats my hair and leaves it feeling treated without feeling coated or super slippery i ve not used this exclusively in the last month but i m shampooing mostly every other day compared to twice or even once a week pre hair cut and use this at least twice a week since adding this to my rotation i ve noticed a few things that i like 1 i am shedding less hair in shower and outside in fact the last time i used a regular shampoo and conditioner i noticed a lot of shedding both during the wash and the following day as soon as i returned to the organix it slowed or stopped enough where i didn t notice the shedding 2 my hair dries with a lot more bounce and volume after using this duo other shampoos and conditioners make my short hair fall a lot flatter but when i use this again it has a nice fluff to it that works well with just a tiny bit of styling product for a bit of hold and or definition 3 while i can t say i see any real hair growth or reduction in thinning it does seem like there s a bit more hair i m not sure if the formula adds volume or maybe i m getting a few new hairs but i ll take it this is a definite buy again product for me i m not sure i d like it if i had long hair but for my shorter hair it works really well and i like the boost in bounce and volume it gives me paired with less shedding one note the price of this product varies wildly at your corner drug store it can be somewhere around 8 but if you visit target harmon s or the beauty department in bed bath amp beyond s that have one or kroger you can find it for a couple dollars less kroger had it on sale for 5 a bottle at one point in fact i d gladly pay 8 a bottle for this but who doesn t love a bargain 
2017-08|5.0|Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine|my hair started falling out in greater than normal amounts due to stress i m pretty sure between school and work i haven t figured out a way to manage my stress and anxiety yet i m 23 now but noticed increased fall out when i was still 22 we re talking more than just the ordinary clumps in the shower there was hair everywhere and i was noticing loose hair that had fallen out of my head and onto my arms constantly i was getting pretty scared watching my long thick hair fall out and noticing that my ponytail was getting narrower i internet surfed for a while and came across this shampoo and conditioner and decided to give it a try the price was higher and the bottles were smaller than what i was used to i wasn t super keen on spending that much on shampoo and conditioner but i was more scared about losing hair so i bought them anyways let me tell you they were well worth the money i wanted the product to last a long time so i started off using much less product than i usually use i heard that you only really need shampoo for your roots and conditioner for your ends for most hair types so that s what i did i m probably going to need to buy more after using it for three months that lasted a lot longer than i thought they would how it feels the shampoo doesn t lather as much as i like but that s because i ve got it in my head that more lather better cleaning but i know that s not necessarily true i make sure my hair is super wet before using the shampoo so that works pretty well and i still get a little lather rinsing it out feels amazing and even before using conditioner my hair is noticeably smoother and softer the conditioner isn t as smooth creamy as some conditioners i ve used but otherwise it feels pretty normal the conditioner doesn t de tangle as much as i d like as i rinse it out but when i comb it out after when it s damp always use a wide tooth comb when damp it doesn t feel tangly at all anymore how it smells i know some users don t like the smell but i love it i somehow thought it would smell like a mix of mint and coffee because of the caffeine in it but it s just a strong sweet minty smell which i love what it did it definitely noticeably decreased the amount of hair falling out there s no way of quantifying how much it stopped but it definitely feels like it s back down to a normal healthy amount of hair fall out i started noticing a difference by two weeks of use my hair has also never felt healthier or been shinier before i know some less high end shampoos conditioners are guilty of coating your hair with waxy stuff to make your hair feel smoother and look shinier according to my very knowledgeable hair stylist and my old shampoo conditioner must have been doing that too to some extent because switching to this product has drastically changed how my hair looks and feels it doesn t feel fake anymore but more real if that make sense and so shiny my hair was decently healthy before since i don t use any heat on my hair but this product was a game changer my hair feels much more natural and it has also stopped falling out at an unhealthy rate so i m happy some users say this product dried their hair out i have no idea if this product dries my hair since i also use this brand s argan oil on my hair ends before i let it air dry i have not noticed my hair feeling dry at all though but that could be due to the argan oil 
2016-08|4.0|Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine|i love this product doesn t seem as silicone y as their other lines major plus and my hair feels soft and silky without being too weighed down the spray treatment seems to make my hair feel fuller i still have to wash it every day major greasy root issues but it feels cleaner for longer i haven t used it for very long so i can t comment on the fallout but i m happy enough with it already to continue buying it 
2016-08|4.0|Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine|haven t used long enough for 5 star yet started this about 2 weeks ago i have very thin and fine hair have been noticing a lot of fall out and with my hair i can t afford to lose more first of all this has really given my hair body that s something i really didn t expect i ve noticed no more fall out as well can t tell if any new hairs are growing in but not losing any was my main concern for now i only wash my hair 2x a week and only condition the res of the days i have found in this short time that when it s time to rewash my hair it really didn t need it my hair has been super shiny since starting this too love the smell as well i ve used nioxin before and it s dried out my hair and made it unmanageable i m sticking with this for now love it so far 
2016-08|5.0|Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine|i use this shampoo twice a week and am starting to see little baby hairs grow around my hairline i don t use the conditioner i love my garnier fructis damage eraser reconstruct butter 
2015-08|2.0|Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine|i stupidly went through two bottles of this before realizing that this shampoo was causing more of my hair to fallout i am 48 perimenopausal and my hair is starting to thin this shampoo cleanses well but is drying used along with the matching root stimulator spray did not help my particular hair situation i have much better luck and no increased hair loss with alterna clinical daily detox shampoo for thinning hair 
2018-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Conditioner|off the bat i ll say that this conditioner might be suitable for you even if it disagreed with me i took a terrible allergic reaction to both the shampoo and conditioner causing immediate irritation with my lips and face swelling and my scalp neck and face soon breaking out in eczema it is a real shame because the product smells lovely and did actually leave my hair wonderfully shiny and soft stay away if you have sensitive skin 
2018-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Conditioner|i love this conditioner it s touch pricey amp also too rich for my hair if i use its shampoo too but just using this conditioner on my damaged tips of hair it really does a wonder 
2018-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Conditioner|honestly one of the worst i have bleached blonde damaged hair and i thought the ogx line would help replenish it but the only thing it does is dry it out to the point where if you picked it up it would stay where you put it levitating awful cant beleive i wasted 10 quid 
2018-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Conditioner|this conditioner gave me the worst reaction i ve ever had to any conditioner ever and it wasn t even an allergic reaction ok so this is gross but it gave me cystic acne on my scalp i never get cystic acne anywhere and never ever break out on my scalp i didn t even think that could really happen but this left me with a big painful not itchy so i know it s not an allergy cyst on my scalp that took forever to go away i think it s either because of the strong perfumey fragrance or because it s filled with silicones i actually had the quot extra strength quot version i think that s what it s called which is like the regular one but i think has more silicones but although i avoid excess silicones in hair products it s just because they weigh down my waves i ve never broken out from them even on my face hairline but even if this didn t break me out it still fails in other departments too it s very heavy and slick feeling but it s one of those conditioners that never actually absorbs into your hair it just coats it so i was left with weighed down coated and dull feeling looking hair but it was still super dry the only good thing about this at all is the scent and the bottle is a pretty color but even the bottle is annoying lol it s bulky falls over a lot in the shower and the cap can get stuck and become hard to flip open when your hands are wet this goes for all ogx products cute packaging but not at all utilitarian needless to say i tossed this in the trash

2017-08|1.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Conditioner|i bought this conditioner based on lots of positive reviews but couldn t have been more disappointed first off i have long fine hair and a ton of it i wash my hair twice a week and deep condition once a week this conditioner somehow made my hair crazy tangled in the shower every time i used it there was no way i could run my fingers through my hair wet under the water still like you should with a conditioner i tried to use this multiple times same issue every time i dont even know how this could have hypothetically left my hair when dry it could have had amazing results but i ll never know because i literally couldn t bring myself to step out of the shower with my hair in that tangled mess i had to follow up every time with another conditioner which regardless of whichever one i used fixed the tangled mess this ogx one left my hair in so i ultimately threw this away maybe this would work better on thicker haired girls i wouldn t recommend this to anyone though 
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Conditioner|i bough this conditioner along with the matching shampoo when it was on offer at superdrug i wanted to get something similar to my moroccanoil repair and i heard good things about this range so i gave it a try it is a very dense conditioner pretty much mask like to the point that it is tricky to squeeze it out and it has a sort of floral smell so at the start i found it a bit too frangranced in a wrong way after a few weeks of use i have been very impressed with the results my hair is super shiny which i didn t expect it doesn t weigh it down at all and feels quite hydrated mainly thanks to the conditioner overall very please with the range 
2016-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Conditioner|bought this at target for about 8 for my 12 year old who has long thick slightly dry hair and it was too drying better than the coconut milk one but not by much will not repurchase if you have truly dry hair this may not work for you inexpensive and easy to find not horrible but not great 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Conditioner|i have been using this product for about 2 months now i will start with pros cons then give my overall review pros the consistency is thick and wonderful it conditions well without leaving any build up rinses clean the smell is nice and not overpowering left hair soft silky and no tangles easy to locate in stores cons price of bottle is high for amount of product bottle is a solid color so you can t keep track of product usage overall rating this was a recommendation to take care of my weave extensions i am currently wearing brazilian body wave texture i will say that i like the way that the product works it conditions very well with a nice shine and doesn t leave my extensions matted up as i said above the price is a tad too high for the amount of product in the bottle would i recommend yes 
2015-08|3.0|Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Conditioner|nice scent almost has a light cologne type scent to it nice and thick consistency coats hair well and you do not need much it is not the best at detangling hair feels soft and smells lightly scented hair looks healthier and shinier and even though the bottle is small i found i did not need that much to coat all of my long hair and it lasted much longer than other bottles its size i have tried before the bottle could be a little more user friendly but still is cute no big deal this just may stay in my routine wish the price was a little less though 
2018-08|3.0|OGX Coconut Curls Styling Milk|gives you decent hold but definitely does not offer anything in the way of moisture 
2018-08|5.0|Sake Essence Rejuvenating Elixir|this stuff is absolutely amazing i have shiny fine dry hair it has been colored at the ends and highlighted i use this after shampooing with the thick and full shampoo from ogx i noticed it really did amazing things after a coconut sesame oil treatment it turned my frizzy crispy ends into gorgeous soft tousled waves the smell is to die for smells like a high end fragrance the bottle is catchy and elegant but sometimes messy for about 9 it was a good choice will repurchase 
2018-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|my hair loves dry oils i have finished a couple of bottles of the sally s majestic divine dry oil i used to like natural and pure oils on my hair but my hair has changed drastically and now these oils feel heavy on my hair i use my gvp kenra blow dry spray and then this after my hair is completely dry my hair hasn t been this soft and silky with any other products including high end brands like kerastase highly recommended 
2018-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i am literally done with ogx ive tried several of their products results are always gross this will be the last of anything from ogx i waste my money on was hoping this could help manage my extremely bleach damaged hair but all this does is make my hair stringy or crunchy when sprayed on dry hair or extremely extremely dry when applied on wet or dry hair it couldnt be how much im applying i literally do a light mist waste of 11 quid save your money the ultimate blends honey serum forget the exact name is literlly half the price and actually works spilling all the tea on this product 
2018-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|such a waste of money this does absolutely nothing do not even waste your time i have thick curly color treated hair and my hair loves oils but it hates this it does not heal or mend spilt ends gives my hair weird shine ugh wish i never purchased it 
2015-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|this looked great in the store when i tried the tester it made my hair look shinier but when i bought it and actually tried to use it on a frizzy hair day it did nothing absolutely nothing wasted my money 
2015-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i have been trying out and testing many different brands of dry oils ever since falling in love with ion s keratin dry oil mist organix moroccan argan oil weightless healing dry oil is definitely the lightest dry oil i ve found on the market yet i have thick hair quantity but it s fine texture this dry oil moisturizes without weighing my hair down those of you with coarse hair might want to steer clear of it amp opt for something a bit heavier greasier the ingredient list is very simple i was a bit concerned about c12 15 alkyl benzoate being on the list i always research ingredient lists before purchasing it is definitely important to learn the science behind ingredients after a bit of googling i learned that c12 15 alkyl benzoate is simply an emulsifier thickener agent the reason i was so suspicious of it is because this dry oil is litterally dry it is very light weight and dissappears quickly yes it gives my hair shine and yes it moisturizes my hair but after a minute of applying i can t feel it on the surface on my hair rubbing alcohol shoved into cheap products tends to do that it acts as a drying agent to make formulas more lightweight but again c12 15 alkyl benzoate is not cleverly disguised isopropyl alcohol so no worries there nothing else on the ingredient list concerned me there s a lot of silicone in this to give the hair slip followed by argan oil and a few more silicones parfum is last on the list thankfully i ll opt for this on days i cowash no it s not my favorite dry oil however i definitely would prefer a dry oil be a tad too light than a tad too heavy 
2015-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|picked this up on a whim when i was on vacation and i m amazed makes my hair very soft and shiny and it s the first great affordable hair product i have used definitely worth a try 
2015-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i purchased this spray for a show that i was recently in i needed to quot slick quot my hair back into a bun and it needed to be as shiny and smooth as possible along with some hairspray this product certainly did the job i would just liberally apply it and smooth my hair back as i went the result was very shiny hair indeed now for every day use this product is good but not my all time favorite i spray this on the ends of my hair after straightening and then i just brush through my hair a little goes a long way and it would be pretty easy to over apply this and make your hair appear to be greasy for that reason i am afraid to just spray over my entire head i don t feel like this product makes my hair appear quot healthy quot just shiny if that makes any sense i also haven t noticed any major long term benefits to using this i will continue to use but i m not sure if i will repurchase once i run out 
2014-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|love this for winter my hair is thin and straight and winter makes it fizzy and static y i use a few drops and work it into my hair after a shower then after a while when it s just a little damp i blow dry on low warm gives my hair bounce and life and i feel like it s protected from the harshness of the blowdryer plus i ve gotten compliments on how nice my hair smells 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|organix argan oil contains argan oil kernel oil cacao seed butter coconut oil avocado oil wow all that in one oil there was another one in organix but there were only argan oil in it this is why i ve picked this one i pair it with la coupe argan oil smoothing shampoo and conditioner as for the organix argan oil it detangles the hair it leaves them silky smooth and shinny love it 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i don t understand the bad reviews for the price compared to other brands with argan oil this is decent i like sally s brand better but this stuff works well for me you don t need to use a lot just a little and it tames frizzy ness and makes my hair shiny doesn t make it too much softer than it already is which is why i gave it 4 stars but it doesn t dry it out or anything if i shower and have trouble brushing out my long hair i use this and it is a great detangler i don t dye my hair and usually don t use heat on it i go natural unless i m going out and my hair is naturally wavy 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|just so that you understand my point of view on this product i have color dark brown naturally darker on top and gets lighter length almost at my waist texture very thin but i have a lot of hair type normal on top but gets dry at the bottom others i don t use heat on it very much since my hair is very straight and easy to style i absolutely love this product i was on the hunt for a good dry oil since all of my many oils are in a pump i don t mind it too much but i much prefer the spray bottle where i live mtl it was 6 99 which i find is a very good price looking at other oils like the moroccanoil i have had the moroccanoil just before and to me it s almost as good and so much cheaper i see the moroccanoil one at 60 00 sometimes and to me it s a lot for an oil how i use it i don t spray it directly on my head i spray one spray which is enough on the palm of my hand rub my hands together and but it on my hair i don t use it on my scalp since we have natural oils there many people wonder why their ends are dry and less healthy than the top of their head the answer to that is that the hair gets it s nutriment and all the good stuff from the blood when you have longer hair all those oils and nutriment don t get to the end of your hair that is why we do not need to put oils on the top of our head and why are ends are usually less healthy than the top if you have any beauty related question especially hair and makeup questions you can always email me and i ll be more than happy to answer if i can 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|smells amazing soften my hair that s all you need to know also the fact that argan oil calms frizzy ends adds moistur and a little shine e to dry hair helps protect your locks from the heat now go and buy it 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i love this oil for a long time i was using one of john frieda s oils i forget the name but it was the one in the red tube with the pump one day i couldn t find that particular oil and got this one instead so much better the light quot dry quot feel of this oil is perfect for my fine hair it adds a beautiful shine helps tame fly aways and adds a level of heat protection should i decide to curl or blow dry my hair i do find that i need to apply it to damp hair and let it dry absorb completely before styling it or else my hair feels a bit greasy could just all be in my head though since it looks fine 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i have purchased this product several times now and overall been pretty pleased i use it on damp hair before i blow dry and on dry hair after i have straightened it argan oil is good for heat protection so this will be a nice product to use in your hair care routine i don t think this product is a miracle worker by itself but it does give a nice glisten and shine to hair while calming frizz and flyaways very affordable price as well and can be found at most drugstores target walmart and ulta for those of you with hair that can easily get oily however beware i have dry hair and if i apply this too close to my hair or use too much my hair can get oily after all this is a concentrated oil spray so what i do to get best results is spray about 12 quot away from my hair in a circular motion and let the spray mist down that way it is not too slick but still provides sheen 
2014-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|my friend bought it for me as she knows i love hair oils and though it s lightweight it s still slightly too oily for me to use to tame flyaways but it s not intensive enough to use as a pre shampoo conditioning treatment i think the amount of argan oil in it is probably really tiny i really like the smell though 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i bought this long ago on a recommendation and it s fantastic i like the smell and it makes my hair silky and feel lighter a must in the colder months 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|its just okay i ve been on a budget so i bought this spray because i really can t afford to buy the salon moroccan oil brand right now it s alright for being a cheapy version the pros of this product are the price it smells great and will leave a nice sheen to your hair the cons of this product are that it doesn t really calm frizz and you have to be very light with it otherwise you ll look greasy as for healing split ends rubbish the only way to get rid of split ends are to cut them off i d much rather have the salon brand but for a girl on a budget this product will suffice 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i really like this i use 2 or 3 sprays of it every morning i don t think i will buy this again because i m getting some higher quality moroccan oil for christmas the one with the blue label and the big orange m on it lol i cant remember that brand right now in all i think its pretty good product it only makes my hair oily when i add too much but this is a grate starter product to buy if you never used moroccan oil for your hair i defiantly recommend this as your first try to see if you like moroccan oil also its only like 6 or 7 at target so its easy to find and pretty cheap 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|this is really good stuff just as good as any on the market even compared to the nuxe dry oil at â 28 its not as heavy greasy as a serum amp i use it on wet dry hair to tame frizz amp give my overprocessed hair a nice shine a little goes a long way definitely buying again 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i have naturally curly hair but i ve never tried it on my natural hair to be honest i only use this to straighten my hair which is about three inches below my bra line when straightened i find that it does truly tame the frizzies and makes the split ends far less noticeable however i cannot vouch that it actually heals them as the product claims this product does work wonders in actually achieving pin straight hair without it the results are much worse this product leaves my hair sleek and shiny and helps drastically to straighten it plus it lasts for most of the school day and smells great 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i have been searching for something to replace one of my hg styling products that has apparently been discontinued frizz ease thermal protection serum and in the process have tried about ten different products this one is a keeper i have fine shoulder length colored hair and wash dry style it daily so my ends tend to get dry and split this dry oil helps smooth the roughness of my ends and leaves my hair shiny soft and manageable it s weightless and doesn t start to become greasy during the day unlike a lot of the other products i tried i ve seen some reviewers complain that the spray packaging tends to make a mess but i just spray three pumps into my palm rub together and then smooth through my hair concentrating on the ends i feel that this distributes it more evenly than just spraying it on anyway it also smells good the price is great got it on sale at cvs for 5 49 and had additional coupons i do not think that this would work very well for people with coarse thick or very damaged hair they make other products under this line that penetrate more and are more intensive the labeling is pretty clear about what hair type each product is for overall i m very happy with this product and will be repurchasing 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|bought this on sale amp while i really like it it s not an essential in my styling routine for 3b hair i prefer a thicker serum as its more moisturizing and takes the place of this product i do love the smell though oh my gosh it scents the whole room when i apply it and has a high end amber fragrance it s best use is for days i pull my hair in a ponytail and there s a halo of frizz sticking out this oil does an awesome job smoothing it out amp adds great shine imo it s non oily but keep in mind i have coarse frizzy hair that needs all the moisture it can get i won t repurchase as it s not for daily use and the bottle will last me a long time 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|after showering and removing excess water from my hair i spray a little bit of this product on my hair before proceeding with my regular styling routine i don t like using hair dryers not only because of the damage the heat does do my hair but the fact that my hair is about 2 5 feet long so it takes forever but once my hair has dried and styled naturally i ll spray a little bit more of this product on my hair this product smells amazing feels wonderful and is so light that you can apply as needed or wanted throughout the day a good product if you find that you can t evenly distribute moroccan oil to your hair with your hands causing it to be more shiny in some places than others 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i wanted to like it i really did i like the packaging being able to spray it on really it s more of a mist is great except that like another review i find it leaves a residue in my bathroom i do not like cleaning it off my tile floor it does not help curb my frizz and in summer that s what i need most it does make my hair shinier and it smells good but i don t see it adding a lot of benefit and it definitely does not heal or mend split ends 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i have had dull dull dull dull lifeless hair for as long as i can remember i have a few greys so i touch up my roots about every 2 months the color i use matches my hair perfectly and lets my natural highlights dark brown with reddish highlights show through but over the past year or so my whole head started to have that dead over dyed dull look i had tried shine sprays leave in conditioners and other various products to try and bring some life back to my hair i even started trying to wash my short fine thin hair every 3 days what i ended up with was a greasy scalp dry ends and a dull build up in a desperate moment as i was getting ready for another root touch up i grabbed this off the store shelf i am sooooooo glad i did after i rinsed the color off my hair and conditioned i sprayed a little of this oil onto my hand and worked it through my wet hair after i blew it dry my hair was really shiny not oily greasy looking shiny but natural shiny after it was dry i misted my head with it so i could run my fingers through and calm the fly aways my hair is soft and looks nothing short of amazing when i woke up the next morning i gave my head another mist before i brushed it out this oil is so light it sinks right in no oily residue or greasy spots just style and shine it comes in a nice pump bottle and the pump reaches all the way to the bottom so it appears as though i will be able to use every drop it has a light pleasant musky scent that is so mild it doesn t quot follow me quot around i think i ve found a winner if anything changes i will certainly post edit it s been three days i haven t washed my hair yet because it has been so dry lately i have been trying to go a few days between washes with as fine as my hair is the hair near my scalp usually gets really flat oily and dirty looking by day 3 i have been giving my hair a mist every morning and the weird thing is it still looks freshly washed and it still smells fine it feels soft and silky my hair literally seems to soak this stuff up and loves every minute of it my scraggly dry ends look much more quot tamed quot too

2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i ve only used this a couple of times so i will update this later i usually don t spray product directly onto my hair because i don t want it to get greasy i like the spray nozzle on this it sprays like a mist and if i hold it far back enough 8in i can spray directly onto my hair it smells nice it s not terribly moisturizing but i like that it s lightweight and will continue to use it and asses its effects later for the will you buy it again quot i put yes only because i can t say no with certainty if you are curious about this product i would say go ahead and try it however don t expect any miracles update i used up the whole bottle and i will not repurchase it wasn t horrible but it wasn t good enough to continue using since my original review i ve been using one and only s argan oil spray treament as that stuff is amazing it s also inexpensive and i don t see the point in using this product when i ve found something that s a million times better this didn t add enough shine it didn t detangle there are better heat protectants out there and the smell is just okay if you want to try it i d say go ahead it s cheap enough 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i purchased this spray when i couldn t find their penetrating oil my first issue is the fine oil spray left a fine oil grease on the bathroom vanity ugh extra cleanup i sprayed it directly only towel dried hair and attempted to blow dry it it took longer than usual the end result looks so so i have thick color treated hair and my hair is looking a little greasy 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray| organix calls their moroccan argan oil weightless healing dry oil an quot exotic precious formula of moroccan argan oil spray that instantly infuses the hair with a sheer veil of shine giving color and highlights a multifaceted glow while it mends split ends and tames fly away frizzies this exotic precious formula of moroccan argan oil weightless spray instantly heals split ends creating soft frizz free perfection while protecting your hair from harmful styling heat and uv damage giving a smooth glossy shine quot whoa there organix healing split ends i don t think so i m a pretty big fan of hair oils as most of yinz know so i was very excited to try a dry oil unlike the organix renewing moroccan argan oil intense moisturizing treatment the weightless healing dry oil actually contains a decent amount of argan oil though not enough to really be considered quot exotic and precious quot i bought my 118ml 4 fl oz bottle at ulta for 6 99 which i think is a very fair price organix ironically is not an organic brand but they are cruelty free this hair oil was made in america organix products are available at drugstores and mass retailers around the world organix moroccan argan weightless healing dry oil comes in a clear recyclable plastic bottle topped with a spritzer i love that this oil is in spray form its so much less messy and infinitely more convenient to use good thinkin organix the front label features the product name product description and organix logo the back of the bottle offers the ingredients as well as instructions in both english and french big fan of the packaging i wish more hair oils were in spray form i ve tried josie maran s 100 pure argan oil for my hair and found it to be too much and i don t find organix moroccan argan oil weightless healing dry oil to be enough i just don t think argan oil and my hair get along what i use the weightless healing dry oil for is to aid in brushing my hair i spritz it three or so times on my brush per section to help my brush glide through my thick hair spreading the oil evenly and kinda helping to detangle organix weightless healing dry oil gives my hair a healthy sheen without appearing greasy unless i get it in my bangs it makes them look pretty greasy and gross as for the claims that this oil will heal split ends totes untrue that isn t possible i really hope that brands stop making that claim soon i feel like its common knowledge that the only cure for split ends is a hair cut it just makes any brand that claims their products are split end menders look silly at least in my eyes i want to mention the feel of this oil it really is quot dry quot as the name would imply giving it a very interesting texture just like the organix intense moisturizing treatment the weightless healing dry oil has a sexy musky scent that really lasts in the hair organix moroccan argan oil weightless healing dry oil is nice for adding a healthy sheen and sexy scent to the hair but don t expect any dramatic results i wouldn t repurchase this product and only recommend it for those with dry dull looking hair if you re looking for a serious hair oil treatment i d steer you in the direction of pure pequi or bhringraj oils or perhaps one of organix hair masks i do love the spray form of this dry oil and i plan to keep the bottle after i finish it to put other oils in 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|for the price it is great product i used more expensive oils before and this works as good or even better i find that it penetrates my hair extremely well it doesn t weigh me down or look like an oil slick on the hair it gives shine and helps with frizz and i personaly love how it smells 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i really like organix products i love that they are easily amp readily available at my local wal mart i live in canada btw shoppers drug mart sells organix as well but for marked up prices when not on sale on to the product i thoroughly enjoyed using this moroccon oil spray i love that it s in a spray bottle i ve never come across moroccon oil treatment in the form of a spray the price point of approx 8 9 cad at wal mart is a great price compared to salon products that i ve used in the past this treatment did give my hair shine and smoothness as it claimed it would it did not heal any of my dry or split ends so don t expect any miracles i just finished my first bottle i purchased this sometime in january and i have just run out of it i wish the bottle was a bit bigger but that s fine i ll continue to repurchase the only reason why i didn t repurchase the moroccan argan spray specifically was because when i went to wal mart they were sold out so i picked up the keratin oil spray i tried it for the first time today and it works just as nicely i prefer the scent of the moroccan oil though 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i have used this product for about a week and am happy with the results i have thick rather coarse wavy hair i give my towel dried hair a few sprays and it seems to make my hair more manageable and smoother it doesn t weigh it down which has been a problem with many other products i ve used 
2012-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i like this a lot it doesn t weigh down my very fine hair and has made it shiny smooth and much easier to comb my hair is waist length and wavy curly and i put this on from the ears down after i shower a little goes a long way it smells nice and i saw an improvement in my hair almost immediately i bought the sample size of this about two months ago and have been using it regularly 2x a week since then 
2012-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|ok i tried this at my moms and was ready to do an oil mask later today but this made my hair nice and soft and more manageable when normally i can t brush thought it without feeling like i m killing it it smells nice and unlike others who said a little made them greasy i put in a few good sprays then a few more and it s just better and better as i go i guess my hair really is dry i hadn t had luck with their argan conditioning treatment or really any other argan treatments but because this is basically silicone with shea and cocoa and i already use silicones like biosilk etc and my hair likes shea and other oils already this is great for me i can t wait to buy my own i guess ymmv like most products but for dry haired gals i think this stuff is nice edit ok why did i think this had cocoa and shea in it online it s saying it s not now i m wondering if i read it wrong or there are two versions would have been cool either way it worked for me when i tried it ok i m not crazy i went to the store and it does have those ingredients idk why all the sites do not list them so maybe there are older and newer formulas just be aware of what works with your hair because i know my hair responds well to those and less so to argan so good to know update i never ended up buying this but i tried a few organix and l oreals of similar types and they all were drying and not so great so i m not excited about this anymore and leaning away from fake oils even pure oil doesn t really work on my hair i have to do those as a mask before shampooing they can either look too greasy or be drying

2012-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|i have fine textured hair that is bleached and toned to white so needless to say i m always trying new products to help keep my hair shiny soft and feeling like hair instead of straw i really like the smell of this product because it has a nice clean smell to it i spray it directly onto damp towel dried hair and then blow dry fantastic for managing frizz i don t use this as a finishing or shine spray afterwards though because i feel like it would be too much for my fine hair so pre blow dry air dry works out incredibly well for me adds a nice shine without making my fine white blonde hair look greasy prevents split ends and is cheap highly recommend this to anyone who bleaches their hair or has damage 
2012-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|it is an ok oil if used on semi dried hair as first my hair is fine mid lenth dyed and damaged it never shines and it s constantly brittle moderately oily scalp this will prolong the soft feeling of a deep conditioning and give shine which doesn t last very long but holds the day i sprayed all the times i used it i wasn t very economical but definitely did not weigh my hand i might try retouching with my palms as the retouch spraying made the tresses a bit oily not much not a great product but not a deal breaker for the price it does a decent job wasn t for the claims and expectations compared to other dg oils it s quite good i have to say this was my first argan oil product willing to try orofluido as it s the best rated for fine hair 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|ew granted i know my hair is dry coarse and in need of a serious cut but this stuff is awful i bought it on a whim i think walgreens had it for 50 off or something and it s the third organix product i ve bought and hated not sure why i bother smells ok but i swear it made my hair drier whether air dried blow dried or flat ironed and oiler all at the same time i tried only using about 2 squirts as a finisher and i have a crazy amount of hair but it seemed like it never dried in it just sat there being dirty i felt like a greasy stovetop covered in dust again ew 
2012-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|while i strongly dislike the shampoo conditioner in this product line i can say that i love the dry oil this is the perfect finisher for after i dry style my hair this product leaves my hair soft shiny amp smelling great 
2011-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|twiggyelf sorry to be the bearer of bad news but this product contains at least three types of sillicones including the main ingredient that said on to my review atrocious i will say that i probably used a bit too much but i was attempting to coat all of my hair which is pretty long i assumed this would be a bit lighter than the organix argan oil that comes in a little bottle since this is a spray i have to guess that i did not use more spray than the normal amount of oil that i would normally use i ve been using the oil in the bottle for about a month or so mixing it with my regular gel l oreal melting gel and getting incredible results my thick wavy somewhat frizz prone hair has been looking amazing with that combo in any event it was obviously too much at first i noticed that it was really hard to dry my hair it was taking way too long then i noticed that it actually was dry but just looked wet ugh this left my hair insanely stringy and greasy much dirtier looking than two day old hair note that my hair is generally dry normal and can soak up plenty of product without a problem usually i suppose i could try this again in the summer when my hair is drier and i can leave it wet for wet look waves but i won t be using this again otherwise what a waste 
2011-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|this stuff is awesome it makes my hair silky shiny and easy to style i will definitely repurchase i don t really like the spray bottle it comes in because sometimes it doesn t pump evenly otherwise great product edit i had said earlier i thought this product did not have silicones but as the poster above me astutely noted it does in fact have silicone therefore will not be using every day but still not a bad product especially for those days when i blowdry my hair straight 
2011-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray|this exotic precious blend of moroccan argan oil spray instantly infuses hair with an allover veil of shine heals and mends split ends gives color and highlights a multifaceted glow and prevents static flyaways this exotic precious blend of moroccan argan oil weightless healing oil spray instantly heals split ends creating soft frizz free perfection while protecting your hair from harmful styling heat and uv damage as it gives a smooth glossy shine restores moisture weightless glossing mist instantly hydrates dry parched hair helps heal split ends infused with argan oil to add allover veil of glossy shine i ve been using this every day since i bought it about three weeks ago it s less than 9 at ulta and you can find it with the other organix argan products on the drugstore side the mist is so fine and the oil is very dry which is a good thing so it instantly absorbs into hair instead of sitting on top of it i have thick wavy curly hair and it makes it so much softer you get a ton of shine that isn t greasy feeling i was using alterna bamboo kendi oil spray but it s 24 this is the best affordable oil spray that i ve ever found update using too much will coat the hair and give an oily look so make sure you spray it on evenly mine has never stopped up or sprayed unevenly and it s half gone i ve had it for months and use it every day so a bottle could last more than 3 4 months with regular use if you use it along with other products with oils or silicones they won t mix right and you ll be unhappy with the results my hair looks and feels so much healthier when i use it and when i don t i can tell the difference right away 
2018-08|2.0|Keratin Oil|i don t understand the reviews here but my experience with my long fine slightly ripply hair is that the product left it dry and unable to comb easily when wet my hair did not feel soft or silky nor comb able going back to hask smoothing conditioner 
2018-08|2.0|Keratin Oil|makes hair feel greasy and waxy cant explain but leaves a residue on hair that makes hair hard to style when i m combing it has done nothing to detangle i thought i was purchasing a good product for my recently red dyed hair but not worth it great price for a sulfate free drugstore shampoo but make hair feel terrible dont know if it s just me though 
2017-08|1.0|Keratin Oil|awful conditioner along with the shampoo from the same range this did absolutely nothing for my hair except make it feel like there was a residue on it which made it difficult to style and left it feeling and looking super greasy and lank by the end of the day it was next to impossible to get out of the bottle because it s so so thick again like the shampoo and although the scent wasn t quite as overpowering as the shampoo it wasn t pleasant in fact to me it smelt like melted plastic i used this 4 times then thew it in the garbage along with the shampoo 
2017-08|2.0|Keratin Oil|i don t like it i bought it because i saw good reviews and want to start using cruelty free brands it leaves a strange residue on my hair it does nothing for tangles and my hair becomes dull shaggy and unruly 
2014-08|5.0|Keratin Oil|just finished doing a review on the shampoo and i absolutely love both the shampoo and the conditioner as well it s very creamy and it s takes off all the tangles in my hair leaving it soft and shiny i also tried the mask to go along with it and it worked just as well 
2014-08|5.0|Keratin Oil|so many middling reviews for this product but it s my new holy grail i must have the type of hair it works best with my hair is long very fine straight prone to oily roots and very dry ends after a botched color job a year ago my hair is so damaged and easy to tangle at the ends i tried everything professional salon brands deep conditioners protein treatments nothing worked my ends were crispy and would crimp if put up in a clip combining this conditioner with the coconut milk shampoo has left me with the silkiest healthiest hair i ve had in a long time all the way down to the ends detangles fine hair amazingly well rinses clean without buildup this moisture penetrates deeply and makes the hair feel healthy and pliable again smells wonderful too holy grail 
2014-08|1.0|Keratin Oil|um i hate this product like really really hate it as well as all of the other organix products i have tried it stinks it doesn t detangle and i realized after i finished the bottle and switched conditioners that it might have been the culprit of all the hair i was losing one lippie for the cutesy pink bottle 
2014-08|3.0|Keratin Oil|i am making my rounds through the organix conditioners i have been trying to find a conditioner that stops breakage and split ends in my hair my scalp is dry and flaky so naturally the ends will be weak the keratin oil conditioner is said to repair breakage and leave strands strong like the argan oil conditioner it has an oil scent but this one has hints of nuttiness as for how well it does it does not seem to do what it claims nor is it effective i do not think my scalp agrees with this conditioner and i prefer the argan oil one over this as the scent is heavenly i think this will be my last of organix conditioners 
2013-08|5.0|Keratin Oil|i love this because its so nice and slippery and you don t have to use a ton its not necessary to totally coat your hair with this like some say fructis it smells like a nice perfume and the sent lasts i can really tell that the keratin and argan oils are moisturizing my hair well i use this every third day when i shampoo and then apply the moroccan argan oil serum blast with the dryer for a bit then loosely braid my long hair and sleep on it soft waves that stay frizz free
2013-08|5.0|Keratin Oil|this is my holy grail conditioner i had given up on finding the perfect conditioner after concluding that most conditioners are just reformulations of the same basic ingredients silicones glycerin proteins and oils and that my hair was beyond repair i bleach and color my hair so it s nobody s fault but my own it seemed i could have either strong stiff and shiny hair or dull lifeless weighted down soft hair no product or combinations of products could give me all of the above i stumbled upon some reviews for this conditioner that stated some pretty amazing things so i thought i d try it what s a few more bucks tossed to the beauty product industry anyway well my hair loves this conditioner for the first time my hair is both soft and shiny i use this along with the keratin oil spray it feels like this stuff puts back everything i took from my hair it s been about a week and i m still scrunching my hair with my hands throughout the day to confirm the absence of crunchiness i can t speak to the anti breakage claim because i m using anti snap a couple of times a week 
2013-08|4.0|Keratin Oil|keratin oil by organix contains keratin and argan oil it leaves the hair smoother and thicker it detangles the hair and make them super shinny love it 
2018-08|5.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|love this product but it s really hard to find it as it s always out of stock it s a very lightweight spray which will make you hair a little shinier amp smoother nothing too dramatic my favorite thing is that this spray will only accentuate wavy hair not get rid of them completely pros pleasant coconut scents very light on the hair not oily which is very important if you sleep with wet hair good price especially on discount keeps the waves makes hair softer cons pump spray thing broke down 
2017-08|4.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i have super thick curly wavy dry hair i use this when i do a loose up do once i towel dry my hair and get most of the water out i spray my hair in sections then i diffuse once it s completely dry i ll spray more of this stuff while i m putting my hair in a messy bun i love how hydrated my loose curls look even when it s in a messy loose bun keeps my hair together without the stiffness and weight most importantly my hair keeps it s natural volume i will repurchase adding other products with this is okay too 
2017-08|5.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|this product works great on my long fine hair i spray a good amount all over my freshly washed hair then comb it out then i blow dry my hair comes out smooth and soft although it doesn t work great in super humid weather but then what does my boss touched my hair one day and she said it felt so soft i love that it doesn t weigh my hair down but gives it a smooth soft shine and nice texture this is hg for me been using it for a couple years already 
2016-08|5.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|it makes my hair so soft and smells really good i will use this after letting my hair dry and it keeps my hair moisturized i will repurchase 
2016-08|5.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i have fairly crappy hair midlength lots of it slightly thick damaged and wavy in some areas straight in others even worse i have zero patience to deal with styling it blowouts using a round brush sorry not going to happen usually i just throw on some sea salt spray and hope i look beachy not unkempt spoiler usually end up looking like my hair is a greasy shapeless rats nest i have never been overly impressed with organix the shampoos and conditioners are both drying and not really cleansing anyway i saw reviews and needed a cheap smoothing styler that does not weigh my hair down this does a really good job of keeping my hair soft and shiny and i swear it actually cuts down on my drying time it helps my hair look polished and not really poofy and frizzy if i do blow dry without a brush i don t use it daily but this has been working better than anything i have tried lately 
2016-08|4.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|background i have thin ish hair that borders between quot fine quot and quot moderate quot i have naturally frizzy hair that about one in every ten asian girls have to deal with this i get my hair straight permed on an almost yearly basis however the ends of my hair are quite damaged and gets very frizzy during the humid months i find that this product is great for people with fine hair who have slightly damaged or rough feeling split ends and such as the bottle s description says it s a light hydration spray it s not for your entire hair just for areas that need just a bit of extra hydration in fact i apply a different hair oil before applying this product as it s good for giving just an extra boost to a concentrated area without making it feel too oily to recap this product is for an extra boost of hydration without making the hair too oily areas like split damaged ends fine thin moderate hair making frizzy hair feel soft and healthy this isn t for applying to the entire length of your hair people with naturally curly or overly frizzy hair this product is too light for that 
2015-08|5.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i recently tried the organix coconut milk line my husband purchased the 25 4 oz shampoo and conditioner and the organix coconut oil weightless hydration spray i purchased the organix anti breakage serum at cvs it was on sale i love how these products work together my hair has a little wave to it and when i use these products together i feel like i can let my hair air dry and it looks shiny it smells nice and it is strong and not damaged this line of organix is by far my favorite and when i flat iron my hair it stays shiny strong and bouncy for days so honestly if i flat iron my hair it can last until i wash it again yes i m not kidding it s that incredible it is affordable for what you get you get products that are animal cruelty free the packaging is made from recycled materials and the products are sulfate free these products are readily available at drugstores supermarkets wal mart target harmon ulta i think that harmon has the best lowest prices everyday i would like to try the organix macadamia one but i honestly love the organix coconut milk one so much i don t see myself using anything else for a while the instructions say to spray on towel dried hair which i do but i also use it on dry hair and i use it as a heat protectant before i flat iron my hair with all of those uses it is bargain at 5 99 at harmon for 4oz a little goes a long way also it has that nice coconut smell and tames those flyaway hairs i would definitely recommend this if you have wavy thick or straight thick hair for strong shiny beautiful hair 
2015-08|4.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i use this on my damp hair before i blow dry it it smells very nice and makes my hair feel very soft it s a little pricey though
2015-08|4.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i love this the tropical fragrance goes well with the coconut water shampoo adding a little shine over my regular creams serums it s very light so don t expect to use it without conditioner it just gives you that little added sheen which makes hair look healthy and soft the fragrance is faint enough to not compete with a body spray but you can still catch hints of it throughout the day the best part is your hair won t be oily by the end of the day 
2015-08|2.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|the oil smells very nice light and pleasant however i do not think this is a long lasting hydrating oil you are better off mixing coconut oil and water in a spray bottle for better results its like spraying water and that is more hydrating this may be because of the texture of my hair it is very coarse so this product may work for someone with less course or thinner hair the packaging is cute but i do believe this product does not have the powerful ingredients it once had when it first came out i do not use this on my natural hair however i use it on my virgin hair extensions i would not recommend this product for the price it is too expensive for the lack of results that you get i would suggest to only purchase this product if you are going out of town and need something a little more on the natural side but because of the price i don t recommend it a few years ago i fell in love with this product because it gave my extensions wonderful results i cannot use this product for my hair because it is not 100 natural and my hair doesn t react to it well this is still a drugstore brand and you do get what you pay for 
2015-08|4.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i like this as it gives me a little extra hydration towards my ends i sometimes have greasy roots and dry ends so i ll put a little in after my heat protectant when blow drying flat ironing and a little more once everything s finished i love that the scent is relatively noticable but not overpowering i do notice though that the pump part can be a little difficult to use and due to the packaging and the size i usually have to use two hands to use it if you stick your hands in your hair you ll likely get some product on your hands and it makes the bottle kind of slippery once in though my hair feels soft and smooth and just a little bit of shine not greasy looking though it s alright for the price i ve had mine for a couple weeks now and have only used it a handful of times and it s barely down i d likely repurchase 
2015-08|5.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|amazing i have used all the expensive oils to nourish my very dry highlighted hair but this is the absolute best i use it before drying and afterwards its very light and does not weigh hair down is absorbed easily and the scent is delicious not overwhelming at all but lovely i cannot recommend this highly enough i have their conditioner which is also excellent i d been using oils that cost 30 plus from various department stores and this is the best i ve found i used a little too much but have adjusted amounts for my hair length very long buy it everyone has different hair even within the spectrum of color condition et cetera but i really think this is perfect and with summer here i m so glad i have this i ve been swimming in lakes all week and a spritz of this afterwards is enough to air dry my hair 
2015-08|4.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|the mist is very light and its not like a spray its litterally a mist which is really nice because if you apply too much i can see that your hair will get very heavy and greasy fast the smell is too overpowering for me i personally like citrus smells and this is too sweet and coconuty like it for the fact that it makes my hair very soft 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i m so glad that i read all of the reviews for this this is great i ve been using salon products but ran out of my usual and needed something inexpensive one of the reviewers said that you need to use the entire 3 step system they were right if you just use the shampoo and conditioner it doesn t work as well you must use the coconut water treatment after it sprays in and seriously leaves your hair looking like you just left the salon these 3 products together are sooo amazing 
2014-08|4.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|my favorite product from the organix line has the same fresh sweet and warm smell as the coconut milk products i have really long fine hair that gets super tangly out of the shower while this doesn t help detangle per se it gives my damaged ends that moisture they need i ve tried the coconut milk anti breakage serum but even half a pump is waaay too much for my thin locks this stuff is great cause i can spray it lightly all over and my hair feels super soft i don t have any curls but this stuff doesn t exactly tame my straight haired frizz i live in the humid south now i m trapped indoors with the heater on all day i d repurchase 
2014-08|3.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i normally like organix hair oils but this one just didn t wow me it smells incredible and is very light doesn t make my hair greasy or gross but it doesn t really stop my curls from frizzing and i feel like the hydration it provides doesn t last very long a decent hair oil but definitely not the best 
2014-08|3.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|strong pleasant fragrance worked well for blow drying used as directed pre dry spray and then as finishing spray hair in general looked less frizzy and ends looked less dry cons did not last dry and frizzy a few hours later and worse after sleeping on it usually my hair is less frizzy after sleep did not really hydrate my hair difficult to use packaging had to wash hands repeatedly throughout use to keep bottle from slipping and sliding this might work great for someone with hair that is not as dry and damaged as mine or that lives in a less humid environment wanted to love it but disappointed in the longevity and suspicious of hydrating claims the price and fragrance were nice 
2014-08|4.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i was at walgreens looking for something to help with dry frizzy hair and saw these weightless oil sprays on sale for 5 99 they had lemon sea kelp keratin biotin collagen argan oil coconut water and coconut i purchased the plain coconut which has a warm quot foody quot coconut smell these are basically lightweight liquidy spray on serums a mixture of silicones oils and fragrance i spray on my hand rub to distribute then lightly work through my dry hair oils serums on my fine hair when wet make it feel gross unless it s hot amp humid out then my hair can handle it but a little on dry hair tames the frizzies amp adds shine this is like a liquidy serum not very oily at all if you want more of a liquidy oil formulated for fine hair i d try the moroccan argan oil light for fine brittle hair 
2014-08|4.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i have mixed feelings about the organix line the shampoos smell incredible but the conditioner seems to be way too thick for my hair i have a lot of hair fall when i put it on my roots so i keep it on my ends only with that said this mist is wonderful it makes my dry ends look so shiny and the lovely smell lasts all day i am not a perfume girl i opt for fragrant shampoos and this spray paired with the coconut milk water organix shampoo and conditioner is great i ll repurchase 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless hydration oil mist|i noticed this when i went to my local cvs to find a new oil spray to try i was trying to decide between the others oil sprays in this brand when i spotted this i had tried the coconut milk anti breakage serum a long time ago and i remembered i loved the smell but the serum was thick and heavy for my hair and weighed it down i was delighted to find it smells the same but the spray was a much lighter formula and flowed in the bottle like liquid instead of the thicker serum i looked on makeup alley on my phone for any reviews there wasn t any so i quickly tested it shame on me i know the smell is so lovely if you like coconuts and the shine is immediate it soften my hair a bit without that gross quot wash me quot feeling it didn t pull my curls down or make my hair look dirty so it came home with me hours later the one side i tested on still hadn t managed to end up curl less i m really pleased 
2018-08|4.0|Tsubaki Blossom |my local boots is always selling organix products in some kind of deal like 2 for 10 or similar i picked this up when they had sold out of the previous coconut water flavour i d been using along with the tsubaki conditioner and was pleasantly surprised like most sulphate free shampoos i need to shampoo and rinse 2 3 times in the shower to get my oily scalp squeaky clean so it s not the most budget friendly option out there the delicate flowery smell was lovely though and when used with the tsubaki conditioner after a week of daily use it really did feel softer overall and my boyfriend noticed without me asking the bottle shape lets it down like all organix shampoos and conditioners why do they still sell their products in such dreadful bottles so unwieldy and awkward in the shower 
2016-08|2.0|Tsubaki Blossom |i bought this because i liked the pretty purple packaging the amazing scent and the promise of having soft silky hair my hair isn t particularly damaged or even super dry but this really stripped my hair it felt so tangly and way too squeaky clean the conditioner smelled just as good but was not heavy enough to take care of what the shampoo did i used this maybe 10 times in total before giving it to my sister 
2015-08|4.0|Tsubaki Blossom |i picked this up at walgreens over the weekend because it smells amazing if you remember gap om it smells just like that and honestly wasn t expecting much i ve used other shampoos and conditioners from organix and wasn t blown away but i swear to you this is different my hair is shinier and softer since using it 
2015-08|5.0|Tsubaki Blossom |my current favourite daily shampoo it has a very delicate scent great fluffy lather rinses squeaky clean and won t leave even the fine hair matted or tangled it keeps blonde hair bright and soft i haven t tried the conditioner as i almost never twin my hair care because my scalp needs aren t the same as needs of my hair however i ve had great experience with tsubaki oil in shiseido hair care so i knew i wouldn t be disappointed the entire head spa gold series lived for almost two years in my shower because for some reason japanese hair care is very rich so little goes a long way camelia oil is known to be gently moisturizing without weighing hair down while a shampoo won t give you necessary moisture ogx tsubaki blossom shampoo will do an equally great job gently cleaning your hair every day and effectively rinsing deep oil packs like coconut etc 
2014-08|1.0|Tsubaki Blossom |this shampoo made my hair really really dry this is similiar to when i tried the organix coconut shampoo conditioner it felt like i was washing my hair with hair gel or glue this is currently sitting in my closet waiting for a second chance i might give this shampoo conditioner a second chance i ll post and update 
2018-08|5.0|Anti Frizz Hydrating Kukui Oil|i am a big fans of ogx products line however these products are so hard to find in malaysia and the easiest way is to buy online from usa or from singapore i have so far not being disappointed by this brand this kukui oil comes in a plastic bottle with a printed description of the product and it promises to give quot good hair day quot they put the words in open inverted commas which i would take it as a temporary method by giving you shiny and glossy look and make you feel happy that your hair is getting better and more presentable but i believe in long term it will definitely give benefits to my hair the oil has a slightly golden caramel colour with a very pleasant nutty smell it might smell quite sweet and lovely but it vanishes after i apply it to my hair so not a big worry of this smell overpowers my perfume or shampoo the cap of the plastic bottle is actually very tight and closes very well to prevent leakage it does not only close the spray bottle but also click to make it close better and more secure i have no issue on its packaging or bottle at all i am quite skeptical of this product at first because it does not give me an anti frizz effect to my hair but it poofs my hair to make it look worse than before application and alot frizzier i ended up putting this product aside and not using it for quite sometime after i switch to another shampoo and conditioner i somehow get back to this oil by holding a belief that it should not perform in that manner and i shall give it a second chance luckily i give it a second chance and try it again and this time maybe partly is because of the shampoo and conditioner i use it really gives me quot good hair day quot and almost no frizz after i use it together with my flat iron the oil is so light that i do not have to worry it overweighs my hair and makes it oily and dirty i surely has no problem of reapply it the next day i know that ogx products might be quite average if you look at their ingredients and their products are not cheap be it selling online or in singapore after conversion of currency but i can just say i love ogx products so much and how i wish that they can be commonly available in malaysia 
2018-08|3.0|Shea Soft & Smooth|has a pleasant shea butter and coconut milk scent this is a basic daily conditioner that detangles hair well it did not add hydration to my hair nor diminish frizz just average to me 
2018-08|2.0|Frizz Defying Kukui Curl Cream, Hydrate Plus Defrizz|this product disappointed me their description of it is a lot about eliminating frizz and it does not do that it does have a naturally great scent and gave me some hydration but it did not defrizz 
2015-08|5.0|Frizz Defying Kukui Curl Cream, Hydrate Plus Defrizz|this stuff is great i have long 2b curls that tend to get frizzy near the crown and can be kind of unpredictable at times i m always looking for creamy curl formulas with lots of moisturizing and curl definition i picked this one up because i had been also using the matching shampoo and conditioner which i absolutely love btw the formula is a bit tacky but it s a good consistency and does what it promises i use it with coconut oil to make beautiful defined but not crunchy curls great stuff will buy again 
2015-08|5.0|Frizz Defying Kukui Curl Cream, Hydrate Plus Defrizz|i am constantly trying new hair products tresemme curl hydration has always been my go to but it is discontinued and this is a great alternative it s on the pricier side for drugstore brand but there s often sales and sometimes coupons i always mix this with gel and it leaves my curls defined and frizz free would definitely repurchase 
2015-08|5.0|Frizz Defying Kukui Curl Cream, Hydrate Plus Defrizz|i don t know what made me try this because it is not a product meant for thin fine straight and highlighted hair which is what i was blessed with but i m so glad i did not only do i now have shine and body i also don t have to wash me hair everyday those with stringy hair know what i m talking about this is truly my favorite hair product my hair has not looked and felt this good since i was in my 20 s 
2018-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Light Penetrating Oil for fine & brittle hair |unfortunately for me this makes my hair too soft which causes it to be extremely prone to static that s not a terrible thing because i can see how on damaged hair this could do wonders this is one of the few oils that actually penetrates my low porosity hair without weighing it down i was impressed that i didn t need a ton even though my hair is around 2 feet long the container lasted quite a while i think if you have thicker hair this could be great it s quite affordable but there are a great deal of pure oils available now that might work just as well without added ingredients 
2017-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Light Penetrating Oil for fine & brittle hair |i bought this thanks to the mua reviews my hair is short chin length bob and bleached toned it is damaged i use a purple shampoo often and even with a conditioner my hair is very brittle i love this oil because it is lighweight and not greasy i use it as a heat protector since the instructions say that you need heat to seal th product into the hair it works wonders the only con is that it s a spray i never know if i got all the back of my hair so i spray more might not be very economical in the long run even though the product is only 10 at the drugstore i will re purchase for sure leaves my hair soft and silky 
2017-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Light Penetrating Oil for fine & brittle hair |i m so sad this product has been discontinued i have fine medium hair and loved using this after shampoo conditioning on the last 3 4 inches of my towel dried hair it left my hair feeling smooth bouncy shiny with movement i don t like the heavier feeling of the other versions of this product it also had a nice light fresh scent that wasn t overpowering kind of like a fresh laundry scent i wish they would bring back the lighter version of this product 
2017-08|4.0|Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Light Penetrating Oil for fine & brittle hair |so this is the last of my 3 step hair routine wash with bicarbonate soda condition with apple cider vinegar and oil with this i apply quite a lot on damp hair and leave it to air dry i ve tried it on dry hair but it doesn t seem to work as well as a product review i d say hair feels healthier stronger it doesn t help me with frizz as much nor does it feel as soft i do like organix range of products for application on dry hair as a styling product i d go for another product in their range but as a step in my haircare regime argan oil does make a difference i was trying to find all natural products as an alternative and so far i m happy with the result
2016-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Light Penetrating Oil for fine & brittle hair |going from brown to blonde hair is extremely damaging to my hair as you can imagine this oil saved my hair i throw a little in my palm after the shower and focus more on the middle to ends and it was great hair absorbed it and it totally helped in repairing my hair still use it now as a brunette and its great shiny healthy soft looking hair plus it smells great excellent product highly recommended 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Light Penetrating Oil for fine & brittle hair |this argan oil is the best i ve used before my hair is fine and gets frizzy often i use a little of the oil after my hair is dry and it stays smooth all day a whole bottle lasts me months but i try not to put it too close to my roots or they will get oily great product though 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Light Penetrating Oil for fine & brittle hair |i like this better than the suave one not as perfumery i put my hair in a ponytail and i put three drops in my hands rubbed them together and use it on my short ponytail ends keeps the frizzies at bay and it seems to give some volume and shine on my short bobbed hair i also like how soft my hair feels afterward and it smells so much better 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Light Penetrating Oil for fine & brittle hair |i am beyond happy with this hair oil it s my new go to hair product i have fine naturally curly hair think taylor swift at the beginning of her career and this oil defines my curls and makes them shiny and bouncy and beautiful i see a lot of this oil in my future 
2015-08|5.0|Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Light Penetrating Oil for fine & brittle hair |i have a couple of the weightless dry oil sprays from this brand but wanted something oilier in texture to use before bed or to use before bunning my hair prior to walking out in the warm weather this gets good reviews on the ulta website so i picked up a bottle it costs around 7 99 regular price i had a coupon so it was a little cheaper this does not come in a spray bottle but a 3 3 ounce bottle that you pour into your hand this can get messy amp drippy since this is a liquidy oil silicone combo my hair is fine amp wavy with a tendency to get dry amp frizzy in certain weather conditions heat amp humidity and i heard the regular version of this is heavier and thought it might be too much for my fine hair i ve been using this on dry hair and it does have a tendency to give a quot wet quot look since it s oilier than the spray on serums so be careful since this does not absorb on dry hair quite as well as the spray on serums this is what i wanted though and i m pleased with this lighter version for fine hair it moisturizers my hair nicely and improves it s appearance not crazy about the perfumey scent but it fades after a while i do recommend this for fine dry hair haven t tried it yet on wet or damp hair just as a preshampoo overnight treatment amp to protect hair when it s hot out and i m exercising i ll probably take this on my beach vacation this summer as well washes out rather easily also very nice product i would definitely buy this again ingredients cyclomethicone cyclopentasiloxane dimethiconol c12 15 alkyl benzoate argania spinosa kernel argan oil ci 47000 yellow 11 ci 16035 red 17 parfum 
2017-08|5.0|Protecting + Silky Blowout Thermal Primer Cream|works really well on my thick frizzy shoulder length hair i use about a tablespoon throughout my hair avoiding roots obvs and do a rough blow dry followed by my hot air brush i get smooth bouncy hair that looks effortless and as a bonus i m not greasy the next day i usually wash it daily so that s a plus if i decide not to i always want a bit more shine but it s not dull looking by any stretch good price 
2017-08|5.0|Protecting + Silky Blowout Thermal Primer Cream|i have only seen this at ulta i have really thick and dry hair to my surprise it held my blow out for three whole days in humid texas gulf coast area wow left my hair so silky and feeling very smooth i will buy with again 
2017-08|3.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Conditioner|this conditioner does a good job of enhancing my waves due to all the alcohol in it breaking the hydrogen bond unfortunately that same alcohol works against any beneficial ingredients in the conditioner i haven t noticed it doing anything for my hair really i m also not a fan of this bottle design it sure smells great though nice and clean and soapy like the best kind of 80 s shampoo flashback if they put this scent on a better product i d give it another shot 
2017-08|2.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Conditioner|smells nice and strong but doesn t do much to the hair wouldn t re purchase 
2017-08|3.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Conditioner|has a strong fresh green scent this is a lightweight silicone based treatment it is a nice detangler and left my hair soft and smooth without weighting it down i did not notice any increase in volume from this conditioner 
2017-08|2.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Conditioner|this conditioner has a great bamboo scent but that s basically the only good thing about it it s just not a good product it gives zero slip very little moisture and it leaves a gunky film on hair there is certainly no added quot fullness quot as it claims i think i would have better results not even using a conditioner after shampooing this one is a miss from organix 
2017-08|4.0|Kukui Oil Conditioner|this brand used to be my go to for sulfate free shampoos and conditioners in the drugstore but once i colored my hair this conditioner was no match for my poor bleached strands and switched to a more intense and expensive conditioner so in short if you have healthy hair this conditioner should be just fine if you have some damage though this is probably not the conditioner for you 
2017-08|4.0|Kuku Oil Shampoo|this brand used to be my go to for sulfate free shampoos and conditioners in the drugstore once i colored my hair it needed a little more tlc but if you have healthy hair this is a great suflate free option it also lathers like regular shampoo which is nice sulfate free has come a long way 
2017-08|5.0|Biotin and Collagen Conditioner|this brand used to be my go to for sulfate free shampoos and conditioners in the drugstore but once i colored my hair this conditioner was no match for my poor bleached strands and switched to a more intense and expensive conditioner so in short if you have healthy hair this conditioner should be just fine if you have some damage though this is probably not the conditioner for you

2015-08|4.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|it smells bubblegummy fruity to me it was my first organix product i fell in love it has good slip and leaves dry hair feeling soft i can get three co washes before need to shampoo 
2014-08|1.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|this conditioner left so much residue in my hair i had to wash it again and really scrub to get it all out it smells great but that s it i have somewhat fine color treated hair so would not recommend for anyone with a similar hair type 
2014-08|4.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i bought this bogo at ulta it smells wonderful and has good slip there is a little protein in this so i have to take a break from using this daily but my hair looks shiny and feels soft after air drying i love the macadamia conditioner more than this but this is a close second it does moisturize pretty decently i like the texture it gives to my hair too it has a creamy thick texture and is pink in color which is different i do have to use two squirts to feel that my hair is properly coated but my hair is never weighed down it rinses clean and the scent lingers for a while 
2014-08|1.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|product was very poor at actually conditioning the hair it was way too light of a product and felt cheap i was using almost half a cup it seemed just to get enough to make my hair feel conditioned i would never repurchase this product again it reminded me of a 99 cent conditioner you d use as a kid 
2014-08|2.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i went back to silicone products a few months ago and picked up this along with the matching shampoo i will say i hate the packaging of this it looks nice but it s impossible to tell how much product is left and you don t get a lot of it for the price about 11 cad not bad but could be better it was a pretty nice conditioner very thick and an interesting pink colour it had lots of slip and made my hair very smooth and shiny unfortunately the protein in it built up and made my hair tangly frizzy and brittle i had to throw it out unless your hair is extremely lacking in protein i wouldn t recommend this 
2014-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|lovely conditioner moisturizers without weigh hair down 
2013-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i had read reviews on this before buying it i first tried the moroccon conditioner from organix which i hated simply because it did not condition my hair but i won t rant about that this awapuhi repairing conditioner is what my hair has been waiting for i am way overdue for a hair trim and color i have super long fine asian hair with that said this conditioner really did help to repair my hair it softened my hair the strands feel stronger and healthier it is extremely easy to blow dry my hair now it s usually a pain to brush my damp hair but since using this conditioner i have no problems i gave the price 5 stars only because i got this on sale for 6 99 cad when it s regular price is 9 10 cad at shoppers drug mart i will be buying the awapuhi shampoo as well my recommendation is to try this conditioner out of all the other ones of the organix line i ve tried the morocon and keratin oils and sprays and they are only o k 
2013-08|4.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i ve already reviewed the shampoo in this line so i thought i d review the conditioner too i bought this line because i tend to leave towards using organic products and i have damaged hair that could really use some love i do like the conditioner but i was expecting something a little different the conditioner is quite thin which i m not really a fan of but i leave it on for around 3 minutes while i clean the rest of my body and when i rinse it off my hair is so soft as someone who has bleached my entire head 5 times within the past 12 months and has dangerously unhealthy hair i am really happy to report that i have noticed an improvement in the past month since i have been using this line my hair is a lot softer and stronger feeling i do tend to rotate my shampoos and conditioners so my hair doesn t get used to products so once i have flirted with a few other shampoos i will come back to this line one thing i will add is that i do have very fine but thick hair and this combo does not weight it down at all so thats always a plus 
2013-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|this product is aaaaawesome i have very dry and damaged overly processed blonde highlighted hair and lately it s gotten so bad that i ve been considering going dark again to make my hair healthier i ve used all types of salon brands and i ve had some luck and some not so lucky but i really like this product because of the price it was only about 8 dollars and it made my hair extremely soft to the touch it smells great and my hair feels weightless and healthy when i blowdry it i liked it so much i bought the shampoo and dry styling oil as well i m not really into organix but the awapuhi ginger line is awesome i definitely will keep purchasing this 
2013-08|3.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i picked this up at my local target for about 6 i have normal hair but need good conditioning for my grays which will take on a life of their own if not well conditioned daily i love the smell of this conditioner and it s working okay but just okay its more like a creme rinse to me than a conditioner it s so thin amp watery i have to be careful pouring it into my hands it s so thin it ll run right through my fingers if i m not careful perhaps the drugstores get a different formulation no complaints with this product but for the price i expect more i ve felt my hair was better conditioned from the garnier suave read cheap lines than from this won t be repurchasing 
2013-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i love this line soooooo much i have tried the organix moroccan oil coconut milk macadamia oil keratin oil and biotin n collagen lines and hated them for some reason my hair adores the awapuhi ginger line absolutely shocked at the results i ve received with this line considering how much i hated their other products they all just smell so amazing and i can t help but buy them and just hope the next will be better than the other i finally found a line by them that works for me yay it smells gorgeous too like the japanese cherry blossom scent at bath n body works absolutely recommend this for anyone who wants fresh clean soft hair 
2013-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i love this conditioner it smells amazing my hair feels so soft and smooth after my hair dries i often like to source out new conditioners and hardly ever repeat products but this i will definetely buy again 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i m so glad i bought the shampoo amp conditioner i loveeee how it smells amp it leaves my hair soft easy to manage and takes any tangles out 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|love the smell of this product it softens and smooths my hair and makes it more manageable i will repurchase when i run out as it is very affordable 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|if my hair approves this conditioner than it s liquid gold i have long platinum bleached hair and have tried a lot of products from cheap to very expensive salon stuff i use this awupi ginger conditioner along side with pantene silver expressions shampoo to remove brass which it does a great job better than john frieda and what a huge difference in the condition of my over processed hair love it it is so soft smooth frizz free and very easy to comb without fighting off harsh tangles oh and best of all it smells terrific this is a keeper for me try it i thinks it would be worth it you can usually find it on sale at shoppers for any were from 4 00 to 7 99 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i have very fine and fragile blond hair and this conditioner detangles better than any conditioner i have ever used 
2012-08|4.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i first saw this conditioner when i went home for christmas it was my sister in law s and she left it in the shower and told me i could use it after raving about it i was a little hesitant at first because i used the organix conditioner in coconut milk and it was like i didn t use a conditioner at all but i decided to give this a try the smell is amazing my hair is very thin so i used it on the ends only and just smoothed a small pea sized amount on the rest and the result was amazing my hair was silky and manageable and the smell remained even after blow drying i bought some of my own a few weeks ago and it s my new favorite conditioner 
2012-08|2.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner| this has really worked great with my hair i did notice more hair falling out in the begining but i feel maybe it was just dead hair that was previously ruined from the garnier line my hair is soft shiny bouncy silky ect i will be trying the shampoo as soon as my tresseme shampoo runs out i will keep you all posted this wound up making my hair very oily but dry my hair fell out by the clumps my hair is much better know that i have stopped using it 
2012-08|1.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|smells delicious but is not moisturizing enough for my color treated hair specially after using the awapuhi shampoo which left my hair dry like straw in a span of two weeks 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|my new shampoo and coinditioner for life i have coarse dry curly hair it gave my hair life like its never had before it makes my hair so soft with no frizz i was wondering why when i went to purchase this it was the last bottles left i m so happy i found this i m an african american woman btw with coarse hair
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i love this stuff it smells great and it does amazing things for my hair which is thick butt length and naturally wavy i usually shampoo and condition with the awapuhi set and let my hair air dry and all is well much like the keratin shampoo from this same line i don t have to add anything else afterward to make my hair look good i kinda wish they had bigger bottles because i go through them so quickly since i have so much hair but i make up for that by stocking up when they go on sale p
2012-08|4.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i really wanted to like this because of all the amazing reviews the first week it worked alright but didn t do much for my hair my hair gets damaged so easily so it needs hard core tlc unfortunately this did not work on my straw like hair but that being said there is a positive part my mom tried this and she loves it she had colored hair and it is somewhat thick it makes her hair soft and shiny 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|this conditioner is a real find it s affordable it really hydrates and softens dry and or damaged hair and it smells terrific 
2012-08|4.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i fell in love with organix s macadamia oil conditioner but after that ran out i wanted to try something different i have 3c 4a hair that dries out very easily this conditioner smells amazing and moisturizes my hair very well i have since repurchased the macadamia oil conditioner again but i still use this one when i need to put some protein into my hair 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|this conditioner is amazing i have very fine hair that i am trying to grow out but some damage from frequent coloring this conditioner has made a huge difference in my hair i have not tried the shampoo in this line as i stick with mastey traite shampoo hg but this conditioner works so well with my hair on it s own it does not weigh my fine baby hair down at all but makes it so silky soft and shiny this may just be my new favorite 
2012-08|2.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|just bought this and the matching shampoo at a great deal from walgreen s last week fabulous duo the conditioner especially delivers softness and shine despite the light whipped texture it has i remember when i first squeezed some out of the bottle i thought quot this is pretty thin how is this going to moisturize or detangle my color treated hair quot but my hair is shiny and bouncy and lovely the scent is mild sweet and pretty very impressed with this drugstore brand and i can t remember the last time a drugstore brand did this much for my hair update started to dry my hair out once the honeymoon period was over 
2012-08|4.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|my hair is a bit thick and is naturally really wavy and on really good hair days some loose curls form my problem is that my hair is really frizzy a bit of split ends and while it doesn t feel like a haystack it doesn t feel like silk i tried this on a whim and i definitely do not regret it i love the smell and for me the stronger the smell the better but i don t think that those who like their products to have a weak scent will have too much of a problem with this my biggest issue with this product is that a little does not go a long way my hair length is barely mid back so i don t expect to only uses a bit of the product but i really have to grab a hearty handful for the bottom length of my hair to feel saturated this means that i use up a lot of product quickly which i find to be bummer because i don t always have time to go to target and means more money spent yet i d buy this again because my hair does feel heck of a lot softer there is more shine it s more manageable and the frizz has died down a tiny bit however i m still on the lookout for other conditioners 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i have very dry damaged hair as a result of coloring it many times i thought it was a lost cause and that i d have to wait until it grew out to have nice looking feeling hair again well i bought this because it s free of harsh chemicals which i m definitely trying to stay away from and the organix line is supposed to be cruelty free it made my hair feel soft and silky and undamaged plus it s not frizzy even after going to sleep with wet hair fresh from the shower this product definitely did what it said it was going to 
2012-08|4.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|i have been using this product for about a month and really like it when you squeeze it out of the bottle it seems like a light conditioner but after you wash it out it leaves your hair so silky i haven t noticed any bad side effects the smell is nice but a bit too strong for me overall a good product 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner|this conditioner has made my wavy coarse hair look so beautifulllll it smells so good too it s thick and really moisturizes my colored hair without stripping it or weighing it down too much it does slightly loosen my waves though but if i blow dry my hair after using this it looks and feels amazing i have noticed i m not getting as many split ends since starting using this shampoo amp conditioner and that s a first 
2017-08|2.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukuí Oil Anti-Frizz Hydrating Oil|in the past i ve used ogx s sea spray which i ve found so good on my hair i ran out of that so i got this instead thinking that it would help with my dry hair in the humidity pro tip it didn t really 
2015-08|2.0|Hydrate + Defrizz Kukuí Oil Anti-Frizz Hydrating Oil|i bought this on sale at rexall for 8 99 cdn so it s not exactly cheap for a drugstore product however i ve been using it for about three weeks now my reaction meh my hair is curly about a 2b 2c curl and extremely dry it gets frizzy very easily my main trouble is getting my hair to cooperate with me in the morning i usually either wash or rinse my hair after the gym every morning and then head straight to work so i needed something to help my hair air dry into something other than a lion s mane i ve integrated this spray into my routine this week i rinse or co wash my hair towel dry and then spray this kukui oil spray into my hair while it s damp comb it out with a wide tooth comb and scrunch with tresemmé climate control mousse the result i think i might as well not use it i find this product way too quot light quot for my thick coarse hair if you have dry curly hair like mine you re generally looking for something to give your hair moisture this is not it fine haired girls give it a shot curlies thick or dry haired girls don t waste your money 
2017-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Creme Shampoo|i had the same experience as the prior reviewer i hated what this shampoo did to my hair it didnt clean well but also didn t hydrate it left a weird greasy film on my hair i stopped using it on my hair and used it up as a shave cream and body wash i think ogx products just don t work for me 
2015-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Creme Shampoo|add this to the long list of ogx shampoos and conditioners that i have tried and hated admittedly this is not the worst one the vitamin b one ravaged my hair like no other and this is not nearly as poor as that this is supposed to be nourishing moisturizing etc but it did nothing of the sort my hair felt really dry after using with the coordinating conditioner but simultaneously it didn t really feel all that clean it doesn t matter which of the ogx shampoos i try they all seem to have that affect on me i m guessing they use really cheap harsh cleansing ingredients why else would the products be so cheap and why don t i learn one of the reasons i decided to give this one a go despite my previous bad experiences with their products was the fragrance i thought it kind of had an interesting high end scent not exotic or spicy more of a gender neutral maybe even slightly masculine scent anyway enjoying the scent is not going to have me using this on any kind of regular basis i might hang onto this for a deep cleansing shampoo also be aware it has a very weird texture it s literally a slow moving goo boderline rubbery it s very odd and you almost have to press it into your hair to begin shampooing odd and annoying i bought the coordinating conditioner and was very equally unimpressed hopefully i have finally learned my lesson on buying their products 
2017-08|1.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|this is the worse treatment you can get for your hair it contains loooots of alcohol and makes my hair stiff and dry like straw dont like it at all waste of money
2017-08|1.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|this spray does not work well in fact straightening my hair was much more difficult than normal when using this product my hair looked worse when using this spray the results were not silky smooth or straight hair instead my hair felt slightly coarser less silky and looked a little chunkier than normal kind of like second day hair it must really protect your hair from heat because i had to flat iron each section two or three times whereas my hair normally flat irons straight in just one pass what the heck since i had to flat iron each section several times it presumably introduced more heat damage than normal since it would normally take just one pass with the iron further multiple passes flatter hair my hair definitely had less volume because of this the mist didn t seem fine enough to reach every hair i sprayed each section of hair then used my hands to smooth it through my strands it was very time consuming and messy what s more my arm and presumably my floor got spray residue on it not a fan of that the ingredients start off promising it contains some beneficial oils and hydrolized keratin a strengthening protein but towards the end of the ingredient list is diazolidinyl urea which is a formaldehyde releaser i d be willing to ignore the formaldehyde if the product actually worked well but alas it made my hair look worse i only did half my head i have very thick long wavy hair so i feel this was a good sample and stopped because i could tell it was not coming out nicely i ll be giving the bottle away sadly what crap 
2016-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|this is the only heat protectant i ve tried and to be honest i don t think it s anything groundbreaking i m sure it s responsible for saving my hair from getting fried in the flat iron but it doesn t improve my hair s condition as it claims i m kind of just using this up mainly because i love how this product smells like coconut cream pie i find myself sniffing my hair randomly throughout the day to be honest i don t smell any unpleasant alcohol scent like others have mentioned but maybe my nose is not the keenest anyway i m content with what this flat iron spray fulfills but i m still on the fence whether i d repurchase just because i know there are so many better products of this type out there 
2016-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i dont know how to feel about it it smells like alcohol but the good thing is it doesnt make my flat iron dirty like other flat iron sprays thanks 
2015-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i ve burned through a lot of drugstore flat iron sprays because i have curly hair i like to keep straight in the winter this is the first one i ve found that actually speeds up the process smells like summer and keeps it straight even in the humidity way better than garnier tresemme or suave 
2014-08|2.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|smells so nice but that s pretty much it i ve been using it for long enough to give it a fair review and only haven t replaced it because i m lazy it s done nothing to the condition of my and unless you wait for a while for it to dry before using straighteners it makes the hair sizzle when going over with a flat iron wouldn t recommend and was a waste of money 
2014-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i have fine and straight hair however i love the pin straight hair so for the most part my hair requires less maintenance i love using this product because it s lightweight not greasy and it doesn t cause me to break out like other sprays i bought this spray because of the keratin product the coconut suntan oil smell and the price the spray releases a light mist for precise application which i enjoy the only con is because it s lightweight it stays straight for the day and i would like a product with longer results i would repurchase this only because my skin is the deal breaker and it gives me a smooth and lightweight application however personally it s not holy grail status and i would like to venture into other flat iron products that are not as greasy 
2014-08|1.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i tried the ever straight brazilian keratin therapy flat iron spray both because it has keratin and was on sale it did nothing for my hair and other reviews are right it smells like alcohol i will not buy this product again 
2013-08|1.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i have dry curly coarse hair that i frequently iron i bought this product with much anticipation after i read the reviews here i am sad to report that this is a terrible terrible product it reeks of alcohol it s amazing how only one or two reviewers have pointed it out firstly it has silicone but i let that go hoping the amount was less but the smell once you spray it is toxic my hair smelled like it was down a bottle of gin it does not protect the hair at all infact i could hear the frying noise and smell once i ironed the other problem is the bottle is so unweily difficult to spray using one hand if youre multitasking i will never be buying or recommending this product buy bodyshop s grapseed oil glossing serum or good old argan oil as a protectant 
2013-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|this stuff smells awesome it has a warm coconut vanilla smell i use this every single time i put a straightener to my hair which is definitely not every day i haven t noticed whether or not this is really doing a whole lot for my hair but i haven t seen any noticeable damage that would result from using heat on bare hair as of right now i would repurchase this it doesn t leave the usual stick straight course feeling that most heat protection sprays use which is nice give it a shot it s on sale buy 1 get 1 at walgreens 
2012-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i bought this on a good sale and the newer bottle that s easier to hold the smell is good however it does have some ingredients in there that i worry about i ve heard cetyl alcohol isn t really bad or drying but there was a chemical smell underlying the sweet smell and i didn t feel it really made my hair as soft as i wanted it to as a matter of fact i was afraid it was drying it i didn t want to try it too many times to test it and i also got the serum from the same line that is just silicone and oils so i stuck to that and returned this 
2012-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i rate this as an ok product i ve been using it for a little while now and find that it is quite good at achieving the straightening side of things as well as making my hair look a little shinier and smelling very nice too however for me it isn t hydrating enough my hair is very thick and dry so therefore requires a product that can provide moisture as well as good protection and straightening it claims to deliver big promises on the front of the bottle such as keratin proteins to help strengthen and soften the hair amp avocado oil and cocoa butter to smooth the cuticle but i can t say that the condition of my hair has improved dramatically nor has it become stronger or softer i think maybe if i had fine or medium thickness hair then it would probably work better but since i am a heat styling addict i don t think this works well for those with thick coarse or dry hair overall i wouldn t buy this again because it isn t hydrating enough for me i have used a lot better in the past but i would probably recommend because it isn t bad at getting your hair straight 
2012-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|honestly i don t understand why this product is getting so much hate i have thick wavy and overall healthy hair that absolutely refuses to stay straight when i use my flat iron that being said i have used this product for several years now and every time i ve used it my hair stays pin straight for the entire day even in extreme summer humidity which is amazing i can tell that it protects my hair and it does exactly what it says it does if you re seeing steam when using you re probably just not letting the product dry thoroughly which is obviously not good for the follicle and if it makes your hair fall out maybe you just shouldn t be abusing your hair with excess heat to begin with tl dr this product is great 
2012-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|after using this product a few times i didn t notice any difference in my hair the bottle was very hard to use no matter how you grasped it it made also pressing the sprayer down difficult if you held it where the bottle was wide it was hard to grasp because of how wide the bottle is if you held it the narrow way you still had to have fingers around the widest part to keep it from flying out of your hand 
2012-08|2.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i have dry damaged hair i tried this product today and to me the directions told me to spray it on a part and flat iron it i did so and saw steam coming which can only mean more damage the result was fried tangled hair that i can t even put my fingers through one of the main ingredients is alcohol which is bad for the hair i will be returning this product tomorrow i ve yet to find a heat protecting spray that didn t suck the life out of my hair and make it feel sticky and strawlike it is difficult to spray on the hair since it seems to saturate a single area it smells nice like coconut i wouldn t recommend 
2012-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|the retail price of this product in australia is 19 99 i ended up buying the product because it was on sale i bought it with the anti breakage serum which was also on sale i m not sure whether i would buy the products again at full price however i agree with another reviewer who recommended buying the products together i have coarse frizzy hair that doesn t straighten easily i ve used other products to straighten my hair and had difficulty having a smooth finish i ve been really impressed with this product because it does give my hair a smooth finish the only negative i ve noticed is that there s a residue it makes my hair feel a bit stiff and because of this and the full retail price i m not sure whether i would buy it again 
2011-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|this stuff is not expensive 7 99 but i absolutely love the scent matter in fact absolutely addicting however the performance of the spray is not a healthy finish i love how it sprays and doesnt way hair down but its not moistuirizing shiny enough for my fine limp hair so my hair looks unhealthy i still have to go over with a shine product anyway serum weighs my hair down so i cannot win im still trying to find a hair product that helps protect my hair from heat makes my hair shiny enough to flat iron with but doesnt weigh my hair down but this is not it it does 2 3 things i want it to do 
2011-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i d say the only bad thing about this product is how hard it is to spray it s a little hard to get a good grip on the bottle but other than that it s wonderful 1 the scent is terrific the scent stays in my hair all day long everyone keeps telling me how good my hair smells lol 2 i have kind of damaged hair and after i used this i could tell it really did protect my hair from the heat of my flat iron 3 my hair is really really soft and shiny especially soft it feels flouncy and healthy definitly recommend this product to people with damaged and fine hair 
2011-08|1.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|terrible it made my hair break off
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|love love love this product makes my hair feel silky soft and gives it tons of shine often when straightening my fine hair it can look dry or get some fly aways during the day especially in the summer humidity but this product keeps my hair looking perfect all day long i wasn t super happy with the scent but i m willing to let that slide with the results i ve had with this product i will be buying it again and again 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i just bought this product during a bogo sale and had to run home and try it i don t straighten my hair that often but when i do i like to have something to keep it smooth and frizz free i must say i really like it the smell is delicious and my hair straightens in half the time i was worried because i have thin dyed hair but it left it smooth and shiny not at all greasy will repurchase if i run out
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i have horribly unruly thick frizzy hair so i was really anxious to try this product out i have had the keratin treatment done at my salon four times and i am absolutely obsessed with it i actually only bought this product because i needed a new heat protectant and i thought this one would be perfect because i would be safe for my keratin treated hair the first time i used it i was totally amazed it made my hair so straight and smoothed it looked just like it does when you walk out of a salon after getting keratin i recommend this to everyone unless you have very fine hair because it will weigh down your hair and take away all volume my only complaint is the bottle the bottle is an odd wide shape so it makes spraying with one hand difficult other than that it is to die for 
2011-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|this product is the first heat protectant spray i ever used it makes my hair smell nice and i think it makes it soft but that might be the anti breakage serum i use along with it it doesn t make my hair sticky i don t think it protects my hair though i may purchase again depending on the reviews of other products 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i ve used a few different flat iron heat protectant sprays and i like this one the best i ve tried pantene s heat protectant spray for medium thick hair rusk s flat iron spray and ion s flat iron spray and none leave my hair nearly as soft or frizz free as this one i also love the scent of the product and the packaging is nice the bottle is small and it gives an even spray which makes it superior to pantene s formua which sprays unevenly and is sticky in consistency this is perhaps a little expensive for a drugstore brand i think i got mine on sale at target for 6 it s usually like 7 8 and it s not a ton of formula either but i think for the results it is worth it i will definitely buy this product again and i look forward to trying out the shampoos and conditioners by this brand in the future 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i love this stuff it s the only heat protectant spray i will ever use again i t leaves my hair so soft and shiny without having to use a lot of other products along with it after i get out of the shower put in a little of the organix morrocan argan deep penetrating oil blow or air dry depending on my time section my hair spray this on and run the flat iron though the results are amazing the smell is a little over powering at first but once you run the flat iron though it gets better amazing stuff i bought all 3 bottles from walgreens because i was afraid someone else would get it lol 
2011-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i like this product i use it for when i straighten my hair and i love the result it gives my hair all natural not coloured wavy curly thick healthy the smell of this product is amazing and it helps prevent frizz i recommend it and i never experienced any negative reactions to this 
2011-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i go back and forth with a number of sprays and this is definitely a go to if for nothing else the smell alone my relaxed colored hair is damaged and is prone to break easily and this definitely helps the smell alone is worth it 
2011-08|2.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|so i tried this after reading the positive reviews on here and after trying the john frieda frizz ease heat guard spray that did nothing for my hair this doesn t work either smells good though i think it may have something to do with the fact that when i put anything wet on my hair after i ve dried it my hair just curls up not sure though sooo onto the next thing i believe i need to go with an aveda product since that s what my stylist uses and my hair comes out sooo straight 
2011-08|2.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i had such high hopes for this product sadly it did nothing for my hair i also hate the design of the bottle which makes it very difficult to spray product in your hair no shine no bouncy no nothing points for the scent 
2011-08|2.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i just bought this today 7 dollars at walmart i was going to buy suave professionals heat protection instead for 3 dollars i have naturally wavy hair that i air dried last night after i colored it natural instincts cinnaberry i sprayed this on and ran the iron through it today and it robbed my hair of the shine it already had and the softness too maybe this is because i didn t blowdry my hair as usual with the usual 5 products and didn t have an already semi straight base to start with i m not sure it did seem to straighten it a bit but my hair definitely doesn t look or feel any better i ll update this review if it works better the next time i properly wash and blowdry my hair until then big waste of money edit well this is no better than any other spray tresemme at least makes your hair feel better the smell is the only positive which doesn t stay anyway i hope at least it protects against damage should have gotten the suave professionals one and saved 4 bucks oh and you get more use out of it if you spray it in your hand instead of directly in your hair 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|i didn t need serum and i didn t need smoothing cream i didn t need anything because this product worked sooo well now it only needs a little little spritz because this stuff will make your heavy but zero frizz it holds the style you make with flat iron exactly and it holds all day long amazing better than john frieda moisturizing and no frizz fried crunchy ends and not even after i washed my hair normally you can seee the damage after you wash but not with this stuff because it really protects hair from heat damage i ve always been half and half on organix products as i think some of it is not so good but this the best product they ve got it outdoes just about everything in my hoarded hair product collection my hair type is about 2c to 3a as it gets more curly in the back a few spritz and a lukewarm iron and my curls are no where to be seen you d think i m naturally straight wow oh yeah and the bottle as other reviewers have said sucks big time the spray pump is the worst i put the product into another spray bottle and it worked fantastic still don t let the packaging stop you because this product is worth it just get a 99 bottle from the travel section 
2011-08|2.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray| edit 6 27 11 i noticed that alcohol denat is really high on the list one of the main ingredients amp though i don t use this any more since i ran out when i was throwing it away i noticed it maybe that was why my hair felt rather dry amp lackluster towards the end of the bottle i liked it while i had used it but i would not spray any form of alcohol the drying sort anyway on my hair when i am actively trying to heal it it may be fine for others with more resilient hair but mine is fragile so for this reason i lowered the rating amp that i would not buy it again drying alcohols should have no place in a heat protectant original this was the first product from this line that i bought but forgot to create it since there wasn t a listing thanks to the other reviewer that did that reminded me to post my own review anyway i really liked this as well i do rotate it with my few other flat iron sprays since my hair isn t entirely fond of protein so i don t want to use an excessive amount usually i just scrunch my hair into it s natural wave but since i have fringe bangs which don t hold a wave well i flat iron them this is always what i use for that as well as regular touch ups when i flat iron all of my hair i love that it doesn t feel sticky provided you don t use too much amp even though i do regularly flat iron my bangs i have not seen much if any new damage the part i did have was from my dye job amp has already been cut off anyway the keratin in this probably helps with not causing any more damage amp really protecting the hair shaft it really leaves the hair nice amp shiny but since i ve also been using my new john frieda 3 day straight that leaves my hair even more shiny so i use that more often but on the 2nd amp 3rd days when i have kinks in my hair i use this to protect the hair i m touching up the bottle is a bit awkward but i didn t have too many issues with it since i turned the spray head so that i could hold it easier mine didn t leak unlike the other review on here so i don t know if some are just a bit looser defective but i guess trying to tip it upside down would be a good idea in the store before you buy at any rate it s not too expensive around 6 99 at walmart 7 99 at walgreens cvs so it won t break the bank like some other flat iron sprays ahem redken alterna 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray|this is the best heat protectant spray ever i ve tried many heat protectant sprays before and i ve never loved any of them as much as this i ve used tresemme s worst it s a 10 miracle spray miracle 7 etc quot it s a 10 quot is pretty good but organix beats them all i use this when i m straightening or curling my hair and it leaves my hair soooo silky shiny and soft i couldn t get over how smooth and shiny it makes my hair it leaves it looking really healthy which is what i feel like a protectant spray should do i don t feel like i m damaging my hair when i use this but with the tresemme i felt like it left my hair feeling a bit dry and frizzy it had no smoothing effects whatsoever i felt like i was damaging my hair when i used it hated it this i will buy again in a heartbeat it s 7 99 at ulta but i ve also seen this at walgreens i hate the bottle it comes in it s an awkward shape and the bottle leaks on top every time i pump the spray i tried tightening the cap but that s not the problem hopefully i just got a defective bottle very annoying but i just poured it into a different bottle and it s fine awesome product update i hope they never discontinue this product my hair just doesn t look the same without this stuff i tried styling without it once and my hair looked dull not shiny and dried out last time i used this i got a compliment on my hair this girl told me my hair looked so shiny and healthy i just said thank you but i knew it was this product lol 
2017-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i have naturally wavy curly fine medium textured color treated hair that is to the middle of my back in my quest to find the perfect shampoo conditioner combination i use silicone containing styling products so shampoo is a must i decided to purchase this and the matching conditioner after reading reviews both here and on amazon the texture is thick and spreads more evenly if mixed with a little bit of water or if your hair is thoroughly soaking wet it reminds me of the old st ives shampoo from back in the 80 s if you are old enough to get that reference it is fine as far as not stripping my hair and not leaving it feeling dry but it doesn t leave it feeling exactly clean either not a big deal when you rotate shampoos like i do but there was one big drawback that made this shampoo conditioner combo a will not repurchase for me and that was the smell it smells like my grandmother s bathroom and not in a good way it smells musty and like old shower to shower body powder or something it doesn t smell nice or perfume y or floral or anything good it just smells old and stale no i didn t get a bad batch or an expired bottle honest to goodness this stuff just smells horrible to me for a drugstore shampoo it s pretty pricey so if it s not working miracles on my hair it s not and the smell doesn t make me swoon with joy absolutely not then it makes no sense for me to repurchase it s a decent enough shampoo i suppose just nothing special or wonderful and the smell for me anyway is an absolute deal breaker ymmv and all noses are different 
2017-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i bought the shampoo and conditioner and really enjoy using both they both have a strong ocean scent which for some may be much but for me i find quite pleasant the shampoo is very thick and needs to be rinsed out well or it can leave residual on the scalp i have frizzy thick straight hair that is stubborn to keep into a wavy or curled style after using this shampoo with the conditioner it gave my hair some texture that helped my hair keep a wavy style and add body not only that but my hair has improved after using a high end shampoo redkin extreme that completely sucked the life out of it my hair is now less frizzy stronger and fuller thanks to this line i definately will be repurchasing again once the bottle is empty and recommend it to gals with stubborn straight hair like mine that won t hold a style 
2017-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|just repurchased my third bottle of this if you have baby fine hair like me don t write this one off because of the name it won t flatten your hair in fact this gets my hair super clean amp full of body the days i use it the smell i can take it leave i just like the performance 
2016-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|so far this is my favorite of the many organix shampoos i have tried i love the scent and it makes my hair feel fabulous without weighing it down although i condition first then shampoo because my hair gets unbelievably greasy no matter what i use hope that this settles my scalp down 
2016-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|very thick for a shampoo seems like more of a conditioner consistency to me this is a little difficult to rinse out but it does clean my hair without drying it out and leaves it soft and shiny i love the scent but it is strong and doesn t fade that much so i recommend smelling it before you buy to make sure you like it would repurchase 
2016-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|my hg i try others but always come back my hair loves this stuff i love the smell and tiffany colored packaging getting last bit out is always tough for me 
2016-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i have seborrheic dermatitis and have had such an itchy and irritated scalp for years i don t have dandruff with it and the dandruff shampoos did nothing for the dermatitis i finally found that putting dead sea salt brine on my face really cleared up the seborrheic dermatitis in my eyebrows so i found this shampoo that had sea minerals in it and it s really helped the itchiness is not nearly as bad it s not a cure but definitely helps 
2016-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i am obsessed with this product and the matching conditioner i have fairly thin hair it s starting to thicken oddly enough but i don t think it s the shampoo and it gets greasy after a day with this shampoo i get two days of wear out of my hair which is fabulous and amazing for my hair i adore the smell my girlfriend hates it but she will survive 
2015-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i have tried a few of the organix shampoos but by far this is my favourite one my hair is on the finer side and usually gets greasy towards the roots more quickly but using this along with the matching conditioner has improved the quality of my hair so much when i first started using it i didn t notice any difference it was an okay shampoo but i didn t see anything special but with continual use i have used up the bottle i noticed that my hair was becoming more hydrated and much more balanced then it had ever been and the lengths in particular did not feel or look dry the formula also does not irritate my scalp and overall i feel that this has truly nourished my hair in a stealthy way without weighing it down seriously impressed 
2015-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i actually really like the shampoo but hated the smell i have very thick coarse dry hair that feels rough and tangled oh did i mention my hair is straight and really long you can imagine the tangles and snags i get but with this shampoo and conditioner my hair didn t really give me problems i actually liked this a lot that i want to try the cherry blossom next my hair felt soft it was shiney and more manageable of course it cleanses well it didn t dry my scalp out either i m currently using living proof right now and it s a huge difference but if i ever need a drug store alternative this will be my go to
2015-08|1.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i bought this because i thought it smelled so good unfortunately this made my very thick fine long hair somehow feel goopy and straw like at the same time maybe it would work better on other hair types but this was a huge miss for me 
2015-08|1.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i have problems with most shampoos leaving my my hair feeling like quot whipped quot feeling like dry not wanting to do anything and squeaky clean it also doesn t help that i have a dry scalp so it s not like my hair bathes in it s own oil to begin with not sure where it comes from but i ve always had problems buying shampoo except sleek look from mid 2000s that one was a keeper even though it had silicones in it cons yeah i m getting the same result as i usually do with this shampoo dry hair that feels like it s been aggressively tamed even though sodium c14 c16 olefin sulfonate is supposed to be less drying than sulfates i think it s just as bad i also tried a hask shampoo that had this ingredient and i m getting the same reaction other this is quite heavily scented it smells like a too intense beachy scent that went blatantly artificial and now that i think of it sprite like that other reviewer mentioned 
2015-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|the first thing that comes to mind when smelling this is sprite yes the famous refreshing drink i can t think of any other thing maybe a pool it does not lather much and upon rinsing it leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped however it does not leave your hair feeling that soft and when using conditioner or a leave in along with this shampoo my hair gets drier during the day like crunchy besides all that i ve noticed a lot more hair falling out and it gets oily quicker 
2015-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|this shampoo is on the drying side so i would recommend keeping it handy as a weekly clarifying shampoo as it will cleanse your scalp squeaky clean and if you have fine hair therefore shampoo 3x week you will earn yourself a dry itchy scalp another good insurance policy to take out in order to prevent dehydrating your already split ends is to rub any conditioner you have on your tips pre shampoo if used sparingly you will see improved elasticity of hair and reduced breakage without lifeless stripping it smells very nice lathers extremely well so a little goes a very long way and a bottle dispenses just the right amount per squeeze i think those with oily scalp but with coarser hair would love this shampoo best extremely dry brittle hair should avoid using this 
2015-08|2.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|this is the second time i ve purchased a set of products from organix after the first set of products i bought from the moroccan argan oil line absolutely bombed for me this was me giving organix a second chance after at least 2 years i purchased most of the sea mineral moisture system in hopes of turning slowing down the sudden hair splitting i was experiencing i was due for a trim but i ve never had split ends like this until after i switched off of the tresemme keratin smooth system i had been using for 2 years i was sold on the incredible alcoholic mixed drink smell of the sea mineral moisture products but unfortunately that s only one of 2 good points for this shampoo my boyfriend also commented that my hair was soft and touchable again but i noticed that my split ends were worsening throughout the use of this product additionally i had the same problem with this system that steered me away from organix in the first place the bottles come with 13oz of product which i had used up in about 2 months compared to the 6 months my shampoos tend to last this shampoo would clarify my hair and scalp so well too that it would leave my strands feeling squeaky dry in the shower so i would use a handful of conditioner at a time to remedy the dryness and found that the deep conditioner from this same line was more effective than the regular conditioner though i interchanged both throughout the 2 months i used the system and still didn t quite have the split end issue resolved i love that this shampoo smelled amazing and cleaned my hair especially well but to leave it dried and not at least slowing the end splitting i was experiencing and on top of that running out of product in 2 months i would rather invest my money back into the tresemme products i had been consistently using for 2 years 
2015-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|this product smelt amazing however because i m blonde i noticed it made my hair extra yellow toned and also made my roots oily if you have brown or black hair that is dry or you don t suffer from oily roots i highly do recommend this product however for what its worth i think their are plenty of other products from your local drug store that offer more product for less of the price xoxo 
2015-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i m torn i find my hair is shiny and more tame when using this it does feel soft but i really am not a fan of the smell and my hair gets very greasy fast with it i use this with the matching conditioner and am not sure which one if not both is too heavy for my hair might try one of the coconut ones from this brand next would not repurchase 
2015-08|1.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|ive always had problems with this brand of shampoo and conditioners after many times of trying different types of this product this has to be by far one of the worst for me i have very dry hair due to dying it and i was looking for a product that would replenish the moisture back into my hair and make it shiny again this did nothing for my hair except dry it out and leave it in knots i had to use half of my detangled bottle to get the nots out and to top that off to me the smell was not pleasant either it just smells like salt water and i personally do not like that scent but my hair is still dry and it wasn t this dry before i washed it with this shampoo i did use the conditioner after however this didn t do much because their conditioner was awful as too 
2015-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i m actually very fond of the organix sea mineral line i think all of the products smell wonderful and whenever i use the shampoo and conditioner my hair is tamed i have wavy frizzy hair and these products definitely helped with smoothing my locks a little goes a long way with the shampoo and conditioner 
2015-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i love this shampoo it cleans without stripping and leaves my hair soft and full plus i absolutely adore the scent it reminds me of a conditioner my mom used to use in the 80 s 
2015-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|okay so i m pretty conflicted about this product i bought this on a whim a little while back and just tried it out tonight i have the shampoo and conditioner so i figured i d give it a try i will say that the experience while washing and conditioning my hair with this stuff was odd especially the conditioner however once my hair was dry it was super soft it took my nothing to brush my hair out which was a bonus for me considering i always dread brushing my hair after i was it cause i know it s going to be full of knots this stuff though left my hair feeling amazing the only reason i probably won t repurchase this is due to the smell i obviously smelt it when i bought it and in the bottle it had that quot sea type quot smell but it didn t seem too overwhelming however now that i ve washed my hair it s all i can smell it s a mixture of old lady perfume and salt is the best way i can describe it the smell is sooo strong that it s almost making me want to rewash my hair with something else i m hoping i can look past the smell since this product works wonders for my hair but so far it s impossible to overlook 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i haven t written a review in years yet i feel compelled to praise this shampoo it has no sulfates or oils so it works perfectly for my fine hair with tape in extensions i have hated every other organix product but love this one my hair is moisturized without build up and isn t greasy love 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture| __reviewtextreadmorev2__ data enableyoutubepreview true data productid 168224 data reviewid 2746834 data text i absolutely love this shampoo it is advertised as being able to quench dry damaged hair with this nutrient rich blend of hydrating sea minerals along with healing green algae to wrap split ends in repairing moisture while supercharged sea kelp transforms dry brittle hair into soft supple perfection it lives up to its promise it does wonders on my frizzy wavy dry hair it leaves my hair moisturized and clean the scent is very strong but i personally enjoy it i absolutely love this shampoo it is advertised as being able to quench dry damaged hair with this nutrient rich blend of hydrating sea minerals along with healing green algae to wrap split ends div
2014-08|2.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|this is a good quality shampoo unfortunately i couldn t get past the fact that it smells like dirty pool water 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|so happy i bought this stuff i have damaged dyed naturally wavy thick long hair this shampoo and conditioner is officially my holy grail drug store shampoo rich lather makes my hair soft and bouncy the only thing that took some getting used to was the smell i didnt know if i liked it at first but it smells kinda nice like a spa treatment also the bottle is pretty but sucks in the shower environment 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i absolutely adore this shampoo it gives me volume and freshness and at the same time moisturizes really well i can feel a difference when i don t use this shampoo specially now in nov the change of the weather can really dry out my scalp and hair alot but this year they are fine thanks to this the only only thing that i do not like about this shampoo is the scent i really don t like it but hey what can i do 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i have fine dry damaged curly hair that i straighten regularly i loved this shampoo it didn t dry out my hair or weigh it down made it manageable shiny soft and cleansed well without stripping it i will try the masque next the smell is very spa like very fresh and crisp i also like the shimmering spray from this line on dry hair to add softness and shine 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i had very dry frizzy ends and an oily scalp i figured moisturizing would be the best way to go to remedy this so when i found that organix had a new product i decided to try it i ve previously used organix products and really liked them and this was no disappointment i love this product after one use i noticed a big difference it reduced the oil on my scalp and moisturized the ends and reduced frizz all around it s such a good product and i m definitely keeping this in my back pocket 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i absolutely love this stuff i dye my hair every 8 weeks and my hair is naturally frizzy and wavy this shampoo and conditioner combo makes my hair feel so soft and wonderful it gives my hair so much body and life a 10 10 would recommend this 
2014-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|hair wavy frizzy dyed frequently a bit dry i was hesistant when i first bought the product because there are so many mixed reviews and the it s quite expensive for something that wouldn t work perfectly i bought it along with the sea mineral moisture conditioner and during my first week i was scared that the negative reviews were correct i thought my hairs felt weird and dry however since the product is quite expensive i decided to continue using it until i finish the bottles i am now on the third week and i couldn t be happier the product is actually working my soft waves are a lot tamer and now i can go out without having to flat iron my hair it s soft and smooth and my friends say it looks healthier definitely buying this product again 
2014-08|1.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i love the tea tree version of this brand but this one made my hair tangled and dry 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|oh my god i m sooooo happy with this entire line the shampoo smells to me exactly as the bottle describes salty beachy minerals haha it leaves my hair smelling good all day i get components on what perfume i m wearing i m a flight attendant so for me i need something moisturizing while away i always get really dry skin and i needed something for my hair as well while flying makes anyone s hair and skin dry and wow i ve tried products all over the world and nothing like this i bought it because of the description and mainly the packaging but what s inside this stuff is liquid gold the conditioner is amazing too it s funny because i tried the macadamia oil line from organix and hated it but this stuff is different so i bought the entire line and i m so happy my hair is extremely silky shiny and smells great all day i don t use heat on my hair so when i let it air dry after washing as i normally do with this stuff i immediately noticed a difference 5 lipsticks way to go organix lt 3
2014-08|2.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i am hoping that if i keep giving this a try i can love it as much as the other reviewers do as of this review i will say to its benefit my hair turns out nice usually when i use it however every other part of this i don t like i found myself cringing when it was time to wash my hair with this why do i dread it so much here is why fyi i have fine amp wavy to curly hair scent at first i told myself it was quot fresh quot but then when i was using it all i could think of was the reviewer who compared the scent to industrial bathroom cleaner and the more i used it the more that is exactly what it smelled like to me washing with it i have used tons of sulfate free shampoos so it isn t just that i know how to make sulfate free stuff work this stuff just had no viscosity it would not quot work quot into my hair or leave the crown feeling clean it didn t even get the one tangled dirty spot i will always get to loosen and because the poor viscosity it tore out caused hair to break so much more because i had to work so hard to get it all around my head to clean when i rinsed this out i always needed to rely on conditioner to untangle that spot that gets tangled it was literally matted up like a fur ball next day hair i found my hair getting oilier faster than usual at the scalp when i used this so getting second or third day hair was very hard so if i figure out a way to love this stuff and i want to because it is dirt cheap i will update and change right now i prefer the gvp generic for biolage color care old version l anza healing moisture or ag smooth or colour savour 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|ive tried almost all the organix shampoos and conditioners this is my fave it leaves my thick coarse hair actually smooth and super soft i have to admit the best thing i like is the fact that the smell lasts the next day and when i shower my whole bathroom smells like a beach 10 out of 10 
2014-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|at last a worthy replacement for my much lamented john frieda cool dip shampoo i ran across this in the drugstore the other day quite by accident and bought it strictly for its fragrance and pretty turquoise bottle turns out to be a really nice shampoo pearly aqua color nice silky texture lathers well and leaves my mid back length slightly wavy colored hair clean soft and smelling great i haven t tried any of the other products in this range but just ordered a bunch online to be reviewed in the future i did not care for any of the 3 ogx shampoos i ve tried so this was a pleasant surprise 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i ve tried many of the shampoos in the organix line the sea mineral works the best for my hair in conjunction with the awapuhi conditioner this combination provides just the right amount of moisture to my hair to lay the foundation for daily blow drying 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i have very damaged hair because i had gotten it bleached and nothing seemed to help my dry hair it was so rough and not soft i tried this product because i read a lot of good reviews so why not give it a try i really love this shampoo and conditioner this shampoo has not only made it softer it actually made it shiny to on the bottle it says it heals split ends to be honest it has helped my split ends but it didn t exactly heal them the first day i tried this shampoo and conditioner i was disappointed my hair wasn t very soft but on the 4 to 5th wash my hair became so soft this shampoo really cleans the hair to people do not like the smell for some reason i think it smells like mtn dew overall i love this product and will continue to use it after i finish the bottle 
2014-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i honestly bought this product because i love trying out organix products but i don t regret buying it i always smell their products before i buy it and this one smells interesting it has a really strong salty smell hence the sea mineral but it usually goes away after a day or two of using it and that s the thing i love the most about this product the first time i use it i went 3 days without washing my hair which is crazy i have straight thing relatively oily hair and this made my hair feel so soft and it kept the oil away for 3 days i would definitely recommend this product to someone who wants to go as long as possible without washing their hair although this was a good buy i wouldn t buy it again because of the smell next i m onto their new coconut water shampoo 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|i was looking for a new shampoo for my highlighted straight hair and tried sea mineral from organix i was using the cherry blossom and was getting tired the scent but i was happy with that one and i just wanted a change and a bit more conditioning honestly the sea mineral formula is the best one and my favorite shampoo the fragrance is fabulous and fresh it is not floral but fresh and almost herbal the way i want a shampoo to smell it leaves my hair soft and manageable and keeps it shiny it is inexpensive compared to shampoos that perform this way and it is sulfate free keeping my hair in good condition 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|hg for my dry aging and wavy hair just the right amount of cleansing and moisture makes my scalp feel good too less itchy 
2014-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|love love love this shampoo i have collarbone length wavy hair and this shampoo makes the most of my natural texture without having to add in a bunch of other products to keep it frizz free i can just let my hair air dry and i get lots of volume and wave which is wonderful i love that this smells like the beach and keeps my hair in great shape all while making my hair routine a lot shorter it foams up easily and rinses clean and doesn t leave residue a problem i ve had with other sulfate free shampoos i haven t always had the best of luck with organix shampoos but this one is a keeper 
2013-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|it s a nice product for dry over processed straw hair i went from dyed black to blonde which can often be a death sentence to hair the shampoo and conditioner really saved the day in about a week my hair was back to a good condition the scent is also a nice change from the super flowery perfumed hair products as much as i liked it there are other organyx products like the coconut macadamia nut that i prefer 
2013-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|love it it has a nice creamy lather and actually feels kind of luxurious it gets my hair clean without stripping it or leaving any tacky residue behind i pair it with the matching conditioner and also have the moisture surge deep conditioner from this line and love them as well it leaves my hair clean hydrated and weightless this line literally makes my hair feel fluffy and voluminous i m not sure if it would be moisturizing enough for anyone with extremely dry hair but it s the perfect amount of moisture for my color treated dry hair after i use these products in the shower i use the organix moroccan argan penetrating oil on my towel dried hair then blow dry and my hair comes out weightless and silky every time highly recommend for anyone with my hair type i also really enjoy the awapuhi ginger and moroccan argan oil shampoo conditioners from this brand 
2013-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|okay so i have used head and shoulders shampoo for years because i have a itchy flaky scalp with oily hair i always try other shampoos though because i am board with the h s shampoo i normally try ones with tee tree and any other high end shampoos to see if it will work with my hair and scalp but nope i always have to go back to plain h s i was at cvs looking for some shampoo and after recently buying the organix moroccan argan oil conditioner i was going to try the shampoo too well i saw that they had this new sea mineral shampoo and loved the smell and decided to buy it well i am soooo glad i did this is my new hg shampoo i have been using it for a month now and my hair has never looked better after one wash without conditioner my long wavy hair was sooo unbelievably soft bouncy weightless and shiny my hair after any shampoo has never felt or looked this good its like when you go to the salon for a good cut that kind of look and feel i had just recently started using conditioner because my ends were starting to look dry from using sea salt sprays this shampoo took care of that problem i made my sister try this and she has verrrrrry very super duper thick coarse curly dry hair and she loves it she doesn t like anything i know everyones different but if you have been looking to buy this do it its cheap and imho definitely worth a try it s perfect for any hair type it seems thank goodness i no longer have to use head and shoulders anymore 
2013-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|okay tryed this a few times and everytime my hair has come out soft and feels healthy it moisturized good id recommend it to anyone for sure however the smell is lk you went swimming in the ocean and never washed ur hair after smells to much like a salt water beach and more me i love the beach but i want to smell clean not like seaweed so i wouldnt buy it agian only because of the smell but if you can stand the smell i would say try it because it does work great i love organix but im going to try a different shampoo and condtioner by them next 
2013-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|this shampoo and the corresponding conditioner are amazing i ve been using the organix argan original and argan creme lines for about 6 months and decided to give this one go good lord my hair looks amazing my overall experience with organix has left my hair super soft and shiny but the sea mineral really enhanced my naturally wavy hair most shampoos weigh my hair down and get rid of my natural wave but i look like a beach goddess after using this my waves are smooth defined bouncy and flowy the smell is pleasant and lingers on my hair after washing will definitely re purchase all my wavy haired girls definitely give this a try 
2013-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture|so i tried this organix new shampoo and i have to say compared to another organix one i was using i love it i was about to give up on organix and find another organic brand of shampoo because these keep my forehead from breaking out but they were just okay for my hair and my hair was starting to dry out and just look thick and dull one use of this on my scalp and the kukui conditioner on my ends and the next morning my hair was shiny and soft love it even if the smell is not as good as the others it is sooo worth it i will update this after i finish the bottle to see if there is any residue or long term affects but for right now my hg shampoo edit hair is still beautiful after finishing the bottles or even more so still my hg shampoo and kukui is hg conditioner hair just keeps staying shiny and healthy finally i was getting damn tired of going through organix shampoos this was only thing that saved me from giving up on the brand entirely 
2017-08|4.0|Hydrate & Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Miracle-In-Shower Oil|i like how ogx has instructions on how to use but out of the 5 listed 4 for hair and 1 for body the last one has worked the best for me 5 on body apply to dry skin in or out of shower massage in thoroughly for best results use on damp skin immediately after you shower this makes my skin really smooth especially to the dry area around the elbows i either dry brush pre shower and then massage this oil after shower or i massage in this oil after shower then dry brush it absorbs well and i alternate it with cetaphil body lotion i rated this 4 out 5 because for the price it works much better than other more popular pricey brand out there i e i bought the body shop wild argan oil after this one finishes it doesn t work as good and it comes in a terrible spray plastic bottle though it smells nice the only reason i wouldn t buy it again is because i want to try other body oil products and i don t really like the smell of this one it s not a bad smell just not sure how to describe it plus i was looking for something to treat my hair though so far nothing has managed to make my hair smooth and shiny silky the way coconut oil raw virgin organic does 
2017-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|so far i ve tried the keratin argan coconut and this one as a styling product by far this takes frizz and flyaways for me make the hair super soft however for curls my hair was permed it doesn t really retain bounce or define curls it s males my hair more sleek and limp somewhat for me that s fine as i have volumnous hair anyway i m impartial to the scent preferring the keratin argan range but it does it job upside it s great as a light mister before i leave the home sleek controllable super soft hair downside scent is so so used often i need to wash more often too as scalp gets greasy faster am definitely repurchasing once stocks come in because it works much better than their oils as a styling product for me 
2016-08|2.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|i wanted to love this but it s mostly a swing and a miss for my fine straight hair pros great smell very beachy but not overpowering or cloying it does provide some light moisturizing but won t help you if you have truly dry hair makes hair feel nice and soft cons it s sorta greasy when i apply it and run my fingers through my hair they come out so slippery i have to wash my hands for quite some time afterward it moisturizes but you have to be really careful not to put even one drop too much on or your hair will go from quot shiny and soft quot to quot grease slick quot in a heartbeat for the price it does not perform nearly as well as similar brands 
2015-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|i love this product i have wavy hair that gets dry at the ends and this stuff makes it super soft it feels light and makes my hair very shiny it s a very fine mist that goes on dry not wet oily when i first used it i thought my hair might have looked the tiniest bit piecey like when it starts to get oily but i brushed it through first with a detangling brush and again with a boar brush and my hair completely soaked it up i use this a couple of times a day now and haven t had the same issue since i put in a few spritzes while my hair is damp and a bunch more when it s dry concentrating most of the sprays at the ends but then one or two overtop of my whole head then finger comb it through followed by a light brushing if needed i love the smell too i know a few people weren t too happy with the scent but i think it s very pleasant my partner told me quot oh wow your hair smells amazing what is that you smell like a mermaid quot the price isn t terrible but it s up there 8 99 cad in my area but i think it s worth it just days after i bought it along with the shampoo and conditioner which i highly recommend as well i found out that all ogx products are on sale at my pharmacy for 3 less than the usual price so i m going back to stock up while they re on sale 
2015-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|i bought this to add some shine to my hair not really to moisturize i use leave in conditioners for that this does add shine i don t spray it directly into my hair instead i spray it into my hands a couple times them smooth it over my hair after it s dried styled i adore the scent i wish they had a body mist in the same scent this isn t something that makes a huge difference in my hair but for a bit of shine and a wonderful scent it s a great product to have handy would repurchase 
2015-08|1.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|the smell is awful i dont know how people say its great worst product i have ever put in my hair the smell gives me a headache i end up sneezing all day too it makes my hair look greasy too i hate this prodcut worst 15 ever spent 
2014-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|i love the smell of this product but it doesnt really do anything for my hair at this price 15 in australia it s not worth it 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|this sea mineral spray is divine i love it it smells great and leaves my hair silky smooth it doesn t always tame fly aways though this isn t a heavy product and it is great for anyone who doesn t like using lots of hair products i have long hair and usually this is all i put in it and my hair looks shiny and healthy i love organix coconut oil and water too i love that the smell lasts smells like the sea or what i think a mermaid would smell like the price is very reasonable it is under 10 usd the price will vary though depending on where it is purchased walmart and target are the cheapest cvs walgreens and ulta are a few dollars more 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|i am obsessed i was looking for a product to bring that salon style shine and this product worked it s magic after i styled my kinda frizzy and wavy hair straighten no blow dry i sprayed this product and brushed it through my hair was so silky and shiny and it fantastic it truly is an amazing product and i look forward to trying other products from organix 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|i love this stuff i wish it didn t cost so much for such a tiny bottle but it does smell great and work great i can spray my hair up to 10 spritzes or so without any greasy look i don t like the shine products that just cause a greasy look i will definitely be buying this again and i plan to give the other organix shine sprays a try too 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|i use this with the shampoo conditioner and moisture surge mask and omg i have to say i love this line i ll will continue to use it for a long long time the only issue i have is the price when it s not on sale it can be pricey for the entire line 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|makes my dry fine hair soft and shiny i tried it on both dry and wet hair it s weightless i prefer to use it on dry hair thou i get better results in terms of shine it doesn t add much moisture thou if it did it would be perfect still great for shine and a great price too smells amazing like the ocean very spa like 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Moisture Weightless Replenishing Spray|i use this spray in conjunction with the matching shampoo and conditioner it keeps my hair so shiny and smooth with no oily look it really is completely weightless best part is it can be used on both damp and dry hair i spray it in my towel dried hair then blow or air dry then spray again for a finishing touch smells like the ocean 
2017-08|2.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner|you can truly buy this cheaper at wal mart than anywhere else i have seen for the price it is there i consider this to be fairly priced because it s not a normal drugstore conditioner it has better ingredients and the packaging is recycled it also isn t tested on animals the packaging is very posh and as i mentioned recycled so i greatly enjoyed it the product itself was not good but not the worst the smell is amazing and tropical my curls weren t greatly impacted in comparison with the other 2 conditioners i ve tried recently which were the bed head red bottle reconstructing one and organix sea mineral moisture i only used this in conjunction with the shampoo so i can t speak as to how it performs with other shampoos this made my hair the shiniest it has ever been but also dried my hair out a bit by the end of the bottle i will not be repurchasing and since it is not one of my favorites i wouldn t recommend it i would recommend people try another coinsirioner from this brand 
2017-08|2.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner|this conditioner just did not work for me at all i have 3b curls below shoulder length very thick coarse wiry hair there just wasn t enough moisturization and there was almost no curl definition it left my hair feeling soft but that s only because it was a big floofy frizzy cloud of fuzz that s not surprising since dimethicone is the third ingredient coconut oil fifth and lemon oil and orange extract are seventh and eighth i don t even get why citrus extracts would be included in a quot moisturizing quot conditioner since those strip your hair i ve seen a lot of mixed reviews of organix products i think i ll leave this line alone 
2017-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner|love this conditioner my hair is very long dry and damaged this works wonderfully to soften and detangle 
2016-08|1.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner|i seem to be the only one that didn t like this made my hair very staticy and left it flat and frizzy it smells really good but that just won t cut it for me as my hair is very fine and heat damaged will not repurchase this or any other ogx product after several bad experiences 
2016-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner|i was super skeptical of this actually enhancing my wavy hair to curls but it actually did not a lot but a little if it wasn t so pricey for a small bottle about 8 bucks in canada i would buy this more often but for now i m gonna use this sparingly and repurchase only when i m feeling like i need some extra pampering 
2016-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner|after i shampooed my hair i used this conditioner it is lightweight and has a creamy texture to it i smoothed the product onto my hair and then i used my tangle tease brush to comb through all the knots with ease but on the downside the smell was again very over powering once i dried my hair it felt smooth and frizz free not sure if i would buy again because of the smell and price very expensive product and i also use this sparingly 
2016-08|4.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner|similar review to the shampoo the bottle is not my favorite but the product is good i don t mind that the conditioner feels somewhat lighter than the shampoo if i was looking for an intense conditioner i d do a treatment or leave in product anyway like the shampoo the conditioner smells wonderful and it does a nice job on the hair very comparable to other conditioners nothing really standing this out form the others but equally as good the draw for me is purely the scent love coconut anything to remind me of tropical vacations is a good thing labelling this with quot curls quot is silly i don t feel like my waves curls are enhanced but they aren t diminished either 
2015-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner|yasssssssss loooove thiiissss my super straight coarse hair is finally turning on me after the latest session of highlighting it s my 4th time highlighting my hair within the last three years and the texture has turned dry and straw like i wanted something cheap ultra moisturizing and most importantly cruelty free this conditioner meets all of my requirements you can feel just how soft your hair starts to become as soon as you apply this to your hair it s also really emollient so even a small amount is very easy to distribute throughout your strands scent is a citrusy coconut so it s not too cloying sweet but it also doesn t really last in your hair would definitely repurchase again 
2015-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Conditioner|i got this and the matching shampoo last year when they came out and i love it i have naturally spiral curly hair 3b mixed with 3a amp 3c s this smells so good amp tropical this conditioner imo is a medium consistency but it works like a deep conditioner i highly rec this if you have naturally curly hair the slip is great 
2017-08|2.0|Curling Perfection Defining Cream|i heard a lot of good things about this but it did nothing for my hair 
2016-08|1.0|Curling Perfection Defining Cream|this was a big no for my 3a 3b hair it barely gave any definition it controlled frizz nicely and even gave it a nice wave but definitely did not give me the definition i see with other products try the coconut curls styling milk instead it works better the smell of the curl perfection cream was nice though alot better than the coconut curls line 
2014-08|5.0|Curling Perfection Defining Cream|hg curl cream softens and defines without weighing down lovely 
2013-08|5.0|Curling Perfection Defining Cream|i m really impressed with this stuff i have wavy curly hair that turns into frizzy flyaway city if it even looks humid outside so it s hard for me to find curling products i really like the way i would describe my waves is crazy and disorganized waves and curls going every which way and i often have to take a straightener to them to calm them down and look acceptable i put the cream on after i showered and scrunched lightly at the ends my hair is maybe a few inches past my shoulder blades and i only needed a dime sized amount i immediately noticed the curls in my hair looked better as it started to dry because i wasn t styling it my hair dried on its own in its own sections and some of those sections were so beautifully curled you would have thought i used a curling iron my curls were soft and quot organized quot so to say and i was so happy i did flip my hair upside down to apply it so the bottom layers were more curly than the top so i have to remember that even after sleeping on it my curls were still manageable the next day the scent is very pleasant but not overpowering at all i tend to get an oily scalp very fast but this didn t leave my hair greasy or crunchy at all humidity protection could have been slightly better but i m currently in the middle of a scorching heat wave with high humidity in my area so great looking hair is hopeless for everyone nothing that pairing the cream with a good leave in conditioner can t fix i absolutely swear by healthy sexy hair tri wheat leave in and the heat uv protection is a great plus i ll definitely be buying this again 
2013-08|5.0|Curling Perfection Defining Cream|wow i m really impressed with this curl cream smells incredible slighty beachy slightly oceany the scent lingers in my hair but it s quite soft i doesn t interfere with any of my perfumes i can t imagine anyone not being able to use this because their hair was scented too strongly this stuff is fabulous i have tried so many curl creams i actually have a shopping bag full of unloved creams but this one is excellent doesn t leave my hair crunchy nor does it feel sticky even in humid weather doesn t leave my fine hair greasy either i love that it creates soft waves even encourages curls instead of weighing them down gives so much body and leaves my hair semi matte not too shiny which i prefer it has the perfect amount of hold small amount is needed nickel i finish off with a couple of sprays of organix sea spray will write a separate review and my hair is soft smooth and moisturized my hair isn t frizzy thankfully so i can t attest to how well it controls frizz the packing is brilliant easy to use squeeze bottle can t beat the price hands down best drug store styling cream for us curlies and i see no reason for shelling out extra cash for something high end makes my hair so curly love 
2012-08|5.0|Curling Perfection Defining Cream|if this is for the moroccan argan oil curling cream this product is great i love literally everything about it it curls beautifully i wasn t expecting to like this product as much as i did but it was a really good price about 8 99 at cvs where i knew i could return it for my money back if i didn t like it for a 6 oz bottle first of all it is thicker than i expected it to be almost like some of the products in aveda s dry remedy line it s definitely not quot sticky quot but it s almost more quot honey like quot like imagine if you took a regular styling cream and put corn starch in it personally i like this about it it seems to absorb water i find it works best when my hair is a little more damp than normal like if i don t leave it in a towel quite as long as i would for other styling products and the curls it produces are beautiful tightly wound spirals they have structure and hold my hair is both fine and curly so it s difficult for me to find a product that will really tighten up my naturally soft and loose curl this one does it also it does not make my hair feel sticky or crunchy it feels every bit as soft and natural as i want it to be so in short it makes my hair tightly curled and beautiful shiny soft natural feeling and it also makes my hair feel and look thicker there really isn t much of a fragrance to this product there is somewhat of a very faint fragrance in the bottle but it is so light that i can barely even smell it by the time i ve worked it into my hair completely the fragrance is gone and what little scent is there is pleasant and mild finally the packaging is really adorable i love the turquoise color the simple shape and the size it looks very attractive on my dresser especially considering it came from a drugstore and the packaging is very easy to work with i will keep repurchasing this over and over again definite hg 
2012-08|4.0|Curling Perfection Defining Cream|bought this ons sale at walmart for about 5 or 6 first organix roduct i ve used and i love it i use a leave in conditionare big sexy hair and just this creame and nothing else i like how it doesnt have a crunchy feeling

2012-08|4.0|Curling Perfection Defining Cream|if i use this on my hair while wet it doesn t do much using it on my dry hair though as a quick fix is great the only reason i wouldn t buy it again is because i m still testing out other products 
2012-08|2.0|Curling Perfection Defining Cream|i got this on sale for a few dollars off of the regular price i purchased this on the same day i got the organix macadamia oil conditioner and shampoo both of which my hair loves very much i have very curly hair so i wanted to try this cream to see if it helped combat frizz and define my curls i have used this a few different times and i am not impressed at all it doesn t do much for my hair it doesn t define curls or keep them together the only plus and the reason i gave it 2 stars is the smell it smells really nice and reminds me of the original pantene shampoo conditioner however there are better curling creams out there 
2017-08|2.0|Shea Soft & Smooth Creamy Hair Butter|i wanted to like this hair butter since my hair loves thick buttery leave ins but unfortunately this one didn t do it for me it goes on smooth upon applying smells delicious and seems to moisturize but it literally feels like i just spread water on my hair with the speed that my hair sucks up the moisture i m talking i apply this butter and the moment i ve moved on to another section my hair feels like i never applied any moisture in the first place this would probably be better for hair types that don t need heavier moisture but unfortunately for me it didn t work 
2017-08|1.0|Shea Soft & Smooth Conditioner|this is one sorry conditioner and it s pretty rare of me to find conditioners that i just can t make work i used this conditioner with the accompanying shampoo to this line keep in mind that i have long mid back waist length dense very thick and kinky hair i was excited to see a line at the drugstore that boasted no silicones or sulfates but when i went to use this conditioner after their shampoo which left my hair soft and still moisturized by the way i could feel the moisture being sucked out of my hair i like to only comb my hair when i m in the shower conditioning and this conditioner made it impossible to do so this conditioner left my hair feeling knottier and drier than a shampoo how does that even happen needless to say this doesn t work for me at all must be for finer or less curly hair types even though i was sure a line with shea butter would do the trick for me i will not repurchase 
2017-08|5.0|Shea Soft & Smooth Shampoo|this shampoo gets the job done and gets your hair clean without leaving it feeling too stripped it s a bit thicker than most drugstore shampoos i ve come across but spreads and lathers easily it smells decadent like a sweet dessert but fades quickly so it s good for people sensitive to smell if i liked the rest of the line i d repurchase but unfortunately this is the only product from this line that i enjoyed and i like to use shampoos and conditioners from the same line i won t say this is the best shampoo out there but if you re looking for a no frills product to just cleanse your hair without leaving it dry with this will probably work for you 
2017-08|2.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|smells clean but isn t clingy and absorbs well with no residue but my skin was visibly dry within an hour of application this is one of the least moisturizing body lotions i have ever tried it s possible i got a bad one but this might be best saved for summer months and people whose skin doesn t need that much hydration 
2015-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|i went for this lotion over others because of the cute packaging and the smell it s actually a really good lotion it doesn t sit in a waxy greasy oily layer on your skin leaves your skin feeling like nice skin that s it doesn t help with alligator like skin but cannot fault it because that s not the purpose and that s not what i bought it for i m sensitive to smells scents and this did not trigger headaches i really like trying new products but i would hope that other lotions i try will end up just like this eta the smell was getting to me a few months in and i no longer use it 
2015-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|to me this lotion straight up smells like shampoo conditioner however i think that s awesome clean and fresh scented it makes me feel like i just left the hair salon or something so that s kind of funny but i enjoy that more importantly it moisturizes very well leaves your skin soft without residue i feel like i went through the bottle quickly 
2015-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|this is my favorite lotion of all time i have the worst dry skin ever in the winter even using this stuff once really just one time makes a difference if i use it every day my hands stay super soft also it smells amazing the smell reminds me of fancy salon shampoo haha love it 
2014-08|4.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|organix argan oil lotion contains sugar cane willow bark rice milk bamboo extract and of course argan oil it leaves your skin super smooth and silky it penetrates the skin rapidly the smell is a mix between bamboo and rice milk awsome lotion awsome smell love it 
2014-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|this is one of my favorite lotions i love the organix line unfortunately the shampoo conditioner that goes with this didn t work for me but the lotion left my skin super soft and smelling great i can t get enough of the smell i have very sensitive dry skin and i only use it when my skin is in good condition i will continue to repurchase this product 
2014-08|4.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|i use this hair care range and love it i was at cvs and found this lotion and had to buy it this is the best body lotion i ve ever used it soaks in really quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft for days it also smells great i went back to buy another bottle but couldn t find it took 4 different stores before i found it again i would definitely recommend this 
2014-08|3.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|i received this body lotion as a gift a brand that i will not buy myself because of the fake image and chemical ingredients i experience this body lotion as a nice smelling body lotion that doesn t leave an oily layer on the skin and works in very quick i can use it when my skin is already in a good condition but if my skin is sensitive and irritated this doesn t do a very good job it is not moisturizing enough and the parfume will irritate my skin and last but not least for the people that don t know yet organix is far from organic 
2013-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|this is the best lotion that i have ever used i have really dry skin and this stuff leaves it moisturized up until my next shower the scent is gorgeous and lingers on my skin all day i could go on and on about how much i love this stuff i highly recommend for anyone with dry skin 
2013-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|one of my favorite body lotions of all it s so rich and moisturizing without being greasy or gross sinks right into your skin and the smell omg it s so nice the moisture lasts for an entire day for me and the scent lasts as long this lotion is as good as high end lotions the entire line from organix is awesome and this is the favorite of mine great for dry skin and normal as well 
2013-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|love love love this lotion i pretty much bounce back and forth with my lotions but this one got me on the first smell the scent is amazing almost perfume but not overpowering i ve worn this to work in the am and can still get a slight whiff several hours later it s very moisturizing with the oils but never oily or greasy def will repurchase again and again 
2013-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|i absolutely love this lotion i ve used it for about a month now and have noticed a huge difference in my skin i use it everyday after showering and my skin is so much softer its not greasy and has a great smell for the price you really cant beat it 
2013-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|honestly i just bought this because i ran out of lotion and needed a quick cheap fix i loved the cute packaging and the smell i used it after the shower that night and wow my husband and i both couldn t stop touching my legs they were smooth and silky but not greasy it absorbed extremely well i have very dry skin and have only ever used body butter but this stuff kicks my body butter s bum i noticed an ever so slight shimmer but it wasn t ridiculous its almost invisible but it makes you look like you are glowing i hope this stuff sticks around and will definitely repurchase 
2013-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|this body lotion is one of my favourites despite my bad experiences with the shampoo and conditioner in this line i absolutely love this product it smells divine an out of the ordinary beachy smells that lingers on your pajama or clothes depending when you put it on the texture is rich and creamy and my skin absorbs it very quickly leaving it exceptionally smooth it s a bit more expensive than the body lotions that i usually buy therefore i use it only a few times a week when i feel like treating myself it is hydrating and smells amazing i couldn t ask for more i will definitely buy again 
2013-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|i love love love this stuff i originally bought the organix morrocan argan oil sea salt spray for my hair and i thought hmmm i really like this scent well how happy was i when i came across this lotion at walmart one day this stuff smells really great and is very moisturizing too it is not a smell you can put your finger on but it does smell delicious it reminds me of summer and beach always happy tiimes i only gave 4 lippies for the packaging because i really prefer a pump style bottle for lotions and this isn t an option with this product i would still re purchase though 
2013-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|ah finally a product i can really get behind ladies your search is over look no more this is the holy grail of all lotions i have searched and searched and searched through what seemed like countless years for a lotion that once applied did not leave a sticky residue on my skin this is it let me start by saying the price cannot be beat i bought it at my resident bjs wholesaler and it cost me 3 49 for an 16 ounce bottle u heard right ladies the smell is divine it stays on the skin for quite a while and it makes your skin feel and look like silk without it being glittery its very lightly moustirizing which for the sub tropical climate i live on is the best thing maybe if i lived somewhere colder and less humid this would not do much nonetheless at least its the ideal summertime lotion regardless of your location once applied the scent lingers a somewhat perfumie youthful scent although i find it very delicate and sensual never have i applied a lotion that absorbs as quickly once applied it sinks it within seconds and leaves in its place a silky texture to the skin not one ounce of that lotiony residue which has been my arch nemesis and the reason im always in the search for the next better and newer thing if i had to describe how my skin feels it would be somewhat powdery but without any graininess whatsoever just soft and smooth and after a minute it does not feel like you have lotion on this is not a product that just sits on top of the skin at all i cannot wait to try the body wash and the other products in this line a strange thing happens when you realize a products cost is not in direct correlation with its effectiveness i have tried extremely expensive lotions which have done nothing for me my advice is to give this amazing product a try ladies for the cost you really dont have much to loose 
2013-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|during the winter my body skin dries out quite badly so during those months i need something richer than this for the rest of the year though this stuff is my holy grail of body lotions the scent is amazing and it makes my skin feel like silk although you don t get as much product in this bottle as most other body lotions i find that i need so little of it to do my whole body that this stuff actually lasts much longer than other body lotions i have used with more product in them organix is a fantastic line of products 
2012-08|5.0| Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion|just bought this on sale at cvs and i really like it the scent is hard to describe it smells to me a little more complex than most drug store lotions sort of like a floral perfume but with a slight citrus and spice note instead of powder which keeps it young it appeals to me and its one of the reasons i purchased it but it is pretty fragrant so some might not care for it smells a lot like the conditioner of the same name i bought it for the scent and because i like the cute packaging of organix and that they don t test on animals i was pleasantly surprised at how ungreasy this stuff is with oils in it i expected to be a greasy mess but this stuff sinks in quickly it gives a nice sheen and makes my skin feel smooth almost like its been powdered there is actually a tiny bit of shimmer but i have to look really close at my skin to see it and it doesn t scream quot i rubbed on something sparkly quot this would be a good lotion for summer i will have to wait several days to find out just how moisturizing it is but right now its looking like a nice light moisturizer i hope they are not discontinuing it and that s not why it was on sale 
2017-08|4.0|Intensely Invigorating Eucalyptus Mint Shampoo|this is pretty good shampoo i d run out of my usual garnier pure clean and i was drawn to the scent description quot eucalyptus mint quot heck yes i find this shampoo to be very clarifying but it cleans without stripping my hair my hair is normal and i can get dry scalp in winter but this shampoo doesn t aggravate any scalp flakes the smell is absolutely heavenly so refreshing and invigorating after a long day i shower at night and i especially love using it after i ve been cycling outside in the heat i paid 8 99 at walgreen s which seems pricey for a shampoo but i expect the bottle to last a good while with 3x week use i will repurchase this to use through the summer but i need a more moisturizing shampoo for winter four stars 
2017-08|5.0|Intensely Invigorating Eucalyptus Mint Shampoo|this is absolutely my hg shampoo for reference i have oily hair with dandruff that has a balayage i have very oily roots an itchy scalp and dry ends i absolutely can t stand moisturizing shampoos as they make my scalp extra itchy dandruff is caused by an overproduction of oil so i need something that rinses clean this shampoo is absolutely fantastic the artificial fragrance is very low on the list of ingredients and it does not smell too strong it contains aluminium lauryl sulfate which is very cleansing but i find much less irritating in my scalp than sodium lauryl sulfate it also contains tea tree eucalyptus and mint oil which are very purifying it has a thicker gel texture which makes it very easy to use it does contain one silicone which i usually hate but it does not leave residue on my scalp what makes this my hg are too things my scalp does not itch anymore even on day 2 hair and it does not dry my ends out i shampoo the scalp only 
2017-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|i m surprised to see so many bad reviews because i personally liked this conditioner a lot it s thick but doesn t weigh down my hair in any way it gives good slip and leaves my hair soft shiny and moisturized the scent is nice as well after using organix products in the past and hating them this was a pleasant surprise i would repurchase it but it seems to have been discontinued 
2015-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|i was intrigued once i saw cherry blossom not impressed scent was pretty poor and not so great did not condition well no rejuvenating happening and i would not repurchase 
2015-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|this is an ok conditioner it does the job of smoothing down my fine and wavy hair while not weighing it down but it does not really moisturize i use this as an everyday conditioner because it doesn t cause buildup and it smells fantastic however if you are sensitive to smells i would steer clear of this conditioner because the smell lingers in your hair long after you ve showered overall i would repurchase until something better comes along i bought it at target for 7 99 usd but this conditioner is available at many retailers such as walgreens cvs target and walmart 
2015-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|this conditioner smells good a bit heavier on the blossom than the cherry part of cherry blossom but it lacked the kind of moisturizing i look for in a conditioner i had to use quite a bit just to cover my hair which falls just below my shoulders and when i rinsed it out my hair felt like wet straw it was a bit better once my hair had dried but it still lacked moisture i ve had better luck with other conditioners and i ll stick to those 
2013-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|i totally disagree with everyone here i found this product made my hair soft and shiny and it s the only conditioner i ve used that hasn t left build up on the ends of my hair i have long thick hair and i find it works great i ll definitely buy it again 
2013-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|was very disappointed with this product as its quite expensive in australia 15 a bottle at first it started great made my hair nice smooth and smelt great i have super long hair so after a while it dried my hair out and then it began to make it knot in massive clumps i ve never had knots so bad as soon as i stopped using this it fixed itself would not buy again 
2012-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|this shampoo conditioner combo made my hair so dry and brittle when i would try and brush through it it felt like i also ha a knot in the back of my hair good thing it was inexpensive i won t use this again 
2012-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|i have to disagree with most of the other reviewers here in that this conditioner made my hair so much easier to manage i have thick hair that tangles very easily when using most shampoos and conditioners however it quickly became manageable when using the organix cherry blossom and ginseng shampoo and conditioner combination the conditioner was easy to apply and i would typically leave for 3 5 minutes as i went about shaving or skincare routines when i rinsed it the conditioner would come out easily and i was never left with the filmy sensation once dry my hair would be smooth and manageable even when i opted not to use any products post shower i would recommend this conditioner to anyone 
2012-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|i hate this stuff it s worthless i have straight fine chin length hair and this did absolutely nothing to detangle or condition my hair i literally threw it in the garbage after the first week 
2012-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|i used to dye treat my hair a lot and i absolutely love this conditioner the smell is fantastic but it also conditions my hair nicely without weighing it down or making it greasy between washes i like the fact that it is organic amp in cute packaging the easiest way for me to use this is to wet my hair and comb brush some through my hair only a little bit this actually lets you use less product for the same effect let it sit for 20 minutes rinse and let it air dry amazing not sure why it has so many negative reviews my only qualm is unless it s on sale it s a bit steep for a regular pricewise 
2012-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|the only good quality about this product is the smell very yummy but avoid if you are sensitive to fragrances other than that this conditioner is totally useless i admit i never quite know what it means when a product says it is quot rejuvenating quot or quot revitalizing quot but whatever this is supposed to do it fails first i hate just getting it out of the stupid bottle even when the bottle was totally full i had to shake it upside down and squeeze really hard to get anything out the conditioner is fairly thick and the bottle is not designed to let the liquid out easily next is the product itself it isn t moisturizing in the least and does not leave my hair feeling smooth detangled and moist in fact it feels rough tangled and dry i ve actually found myself using a lot more leave in conditioner when using this conditioner in order to compensate not good 
2011-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|i love this it s doesn t leave heavy residue in my hair and my air still feels soft and silky i love the smell too i love that this doesn t make my hair feel greasy
2011-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|not a good conditioner unfortunately it left my hair very tangled and difficult to blowdry its 2 main saving graces are its soft but luscious fragrance that lingers in my hair and the shine it gives i bought a huge bottle on sale at cvs so i ll just use up the bottle but will never repurchase 
2011-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|completely agree with other comments here my hair was never tangled until i used this stuff my hair is fine and i worry about hair loss this morning i lost a huge chunk just trying to comb out the mess i had been using kiss my face whenever shampoo and conditioner and saw this at cvs thought it smelled good and wanted to try something different big mistake i go to an organic hair salon for highlights and am convinced organic products have helped my sensitive scalp tremendously but i d rather go back to a sulfate product than use organix again 
2011-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|picked this up at walmart when i needed some more conditioner mostly because the sulfate free label caught my eye and the smell was really nice the bottle is 3 4 gone so it thought that its time to do a review on this one what i love about this conditioner is the smell heavenly by bathroom smells amazing for the entire day and the smell stays in my hair until my next wash i wash my hair once every 3 days but i do wear my hair up the majority of the time so maybe thats why but the smell also withstands heat styling too i get compliments on how good my hair smells all the time in reality tho i did not find this to be a good conditioner at all i leave the shower and my hair is soooo tangled it s ridicoulous i might as well just not have conditioned at all i spend a half hour trying to carefully comb through my hair after towel drying and i can just hear my hair screaming this is not moisturizing in the slightest bit and it tangles your hair like no other horrible conditioner 
2011-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|tried the organix brand b c i have been experimenting with sls free hair care and this is available at cvs really love this scent and am pretty happy with the shampoo but man this conditioner is pretty terrible my hair is pretty agreeable and this conditioner dried it out and just did not do its job 
2011-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|i tried this conditioner and was very upset that i wasted money on it my hair never tangles with conditioner and i have tried so many different kinds this conditioner left my hair tangled and dry and feeling like straw it smells great but after i rinsed my hair it left it smelling musty not impressed at all a day later my hair feels sooooooo rough abd broken and poofy i would never recomend this product

2011-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|worst shampoo and conditioner ever did nothing for my hair but turn it into straw i have naturally straight and fine hair and after using this my hair just broke off while brushing and it felt like sandpaper this stuff has harsher chemicals than dishsoap wouldnt use it on my dog
2011-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|so many times i ve sniffed the various offerings from organix but finally decided to buy this great copy about rejuvenating effects on the package but not realistically expecting much from ginseng and other botanicals listed after fragrance and preservatives the end of an ingredient profile just looking for a sensual experience and smooth silky hair applying to my short fine textured hair this did not feel detangling or work through easily and on rinse it did not feel clean and smooth once dry my hair seemed ok at first but by the afternoon my hair looked dirty and felt gummy this was really an unpleasant un sensual experience even the fragrance was less than all that out of the bottle i think i ll actually return this i feel ripped off and want recompense 
2011-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|this is a wonderful conditioner the smell is heavenly the packaging is cute and functional this conditioner goes into my hair easily and it also rinses out easily unlike some other conditioners that take a long time to rinse out i use this with the coordinating shampoo and my hair is soft and shiny i recommend this conditioner 
2010-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|this conditioner isn t bad but it s not amazing either i bought it for 6 99 fred meyer because i really liked the smell and the ingredients seemed good too but after using up the bottle it didn t do anything special it s just an average conditioner that smells pretty yummy i might buy it again but probably in a different scent 
2010-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|i bought this because it was the closest in scent to victoria s secret so sexy collection this conditioner was so watery it did not feel like it was coating my hair at all i use three times the usual amount for other conditioners and my hair still gets really tangly afterwards i lose a lot of hair in the shower trying to untangle my hair when drying the ingredients list looked okay but i think most of the product is seriously just water 
2010-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|the 27oz bottle was on sale for 4 99 at cvs so i had to check it out all their shampoos amp conditioners smelled so nice but i picked this one and i m glad i did since the others got such bad reviews this works like any other conditioner the consistency was somewhat thick but not as thick as i d like i prefer the ones that really coat my strands it was easy to rinse out and it left my hair smelling very nice i ve only used it once so i ll have to wait and see the long term affects it s not an hg but not a waste of money either although i would not have bought if if it wasn t on sale 
2010-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|really quite nice makes my hair soft amp silky doesn t weigh it down basic conditioner proves that organic does not have to equal expensive or ineffective smells good but not necessarily my favorite scent of the line 
2010-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|gals are you serious i actually found this conditioner to be absolutely worthless it feels as it doesn t do anything for hair like a skipped the conditioning step after shampooing entirely natural ingredients good but for chrissake it has to demonstrate at least some effect btw my sister also tried it and agrees with me so you can count this one review for 2 will not buy again 
2010-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|smells amazing the packaging is super cute organic leaves my hair feeling nice and soft zero complaints here 
2010-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|wow this conditioner works just as well if not better than any salon brand i ve tried it makes my hair so silky and manageable and it smells wonderful so cheap too love 
2009-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Conditioner|creamy and rinses well leaves hair soft and combable great cherry blossom scent nice pink bottle my first organic conditioner and i m pleased with it got it at cvs for a sale price of 4 99 nice product 
2017-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|this product is better than some and worse than others the best thing about it is how wonderful it smells the worst is how much product i have to use each time to cover my hair which is about at shoulder blade length i feel like sometimes it works alright and other times it feels like it dries my hair out pretty bad i believe it feels more dry when i pair it with the same shampoo and conditioner afterward i do not think i ll purchase this again i have ended up just using my jar of coconut oil over this product 
2016-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|this is the worst shampoo and conditioner i have ever tried it actually makes your hair dryer and dull less 
2015-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|to me this was an ok product nothing really special about it it left my hair soft but i felt like they were oily easier i usually go 3 days without washing but by the end of the second day they felt kind of oily the smell is soft nothing fancy or out of the ordinary a great shampoo conditioner smell if that make any sense like some others reviewers i hate the bottle it s pretty but it s hard to squeeze and you can t squeeze it to get the last drop and it s hard to cut to get it too i would not repurchase it s just an ok product so the search really continue for the hg 
2015-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i bought this product because i loved the way my friend s hair smelled and she said this conditioner was her secret while the scent is nice this conditioner only gives good results during the spring and fall seasons when there is no humidity but once the rainy season and high summer are in swing i have to shelve it because it doesn t help with frizz at all i hate the packaging because it is so hard to squeeze out the last drops and cannot be stored upside down also i ve learned that products that claim to contain argan oil need to have at least 20 argan oil in their composition for them to be effective i don t think organix contains that much argan oil because other argan oil products give much better results in particular moroccan oil and josie maran so even though organix is cheaper i will not repurchase 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|this has somewhat helped my hair after i bleached it three times and then just died it black again i feel like it is absorbed into the ends and does make a difference the smell is okay 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i use this once a week after i shampoo i air dry it using the garnier sleek and shine serum but i feel like i don t even need to add that because my hair feels really silky already when it has air dried i leave it in the shower for 5 7 minutes without putting on a shower cap for i think it does the job well without it i put a tiny bit on the top of my head avoiding the scalp in case it gets oily later the price is 20 in farmers new zealand unfortunately whereas in other countries is cheaper but it s worth the extra money i believe 
2014-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i have thick ish dry curly hair and my hair gets so tangly that i usually have to use so much conditioner while using this conditioner i used half as much as i used to use it also made it way easier to brush through my hair in the shower taking a shower and washing conditioning my hair is way quicker than normal which is good because i m usually in a rush this conditioner leaves my hair way softer than normal and the moroccan argan oil leaves it smelling really good it s kind of expensive for conditioner but i ve been repurchasing for the past two years and will continue give it a try and hopefully it ll give you the same results as it did for me 
2014-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i have thick coarse curly hair with dry ends and roots that can get oily this conditioner didn t work for me it was moisturizing but weighed down my curls too much the bottle s plastic is too thick to squeeze to get the product out and the curved top of the bottle doesn t let you store it upside down others have raved about the scent but i m not impressed i m using it up b c of the price but won t buy again 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i like this and have used up a full bottle it leaves the end of my hair moisturized but not greasy however i recently noticed how far you have to get down the ingredients list before coming across any oil for that reason alone i will not repurchase i think i ll just go ahead and buy some real oil for future purchases 
2013-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|didn t moisturize my hair at all i m talking about the organix morrocan oil deep conditioner in the tub i still have it and i m pretty sure i m going to dump it out seriously this stuff is awful 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|hair background thick wavy coarse on it s own without the aid of leave in conditioners or hair serums ends damaged from heat styling i think that this product works well with my established hair regimen i wash my hair every other day using organix tea tree mint shampoo amp conditioner and about every two or three washes i use this renewing treatment in place of my regular conditioner after shampooing i apply this liberally throughout my hair focusing the product on the ends i leave it in for about 7 10 minutes while i resume the rest of my shower routine i love how my hair feels when this rinses out so soft silky and smooth i also need to mention that this smells heavenly and the scent lingers long after my hair has dried so if that s not your thing then this may not be the product for you fortunately i quite like this effect and i find the scent delicious for those of you looking for an overnight miracle hair product this isn t it i nearly finished my first tub before i started to notice a significant improvement in the texture of my hair consistency is key as well as using this in conjunction with other organix products like the the instructions recommend i m now on my fifth tub and i will continue to repurchase as i have finally found the right products to make up the system that works for me i follow up with a small amount of organix keratin anti breakage serum on my damp towel dried hair and then biosilk silk therapy hair serum after straightening the result my hair is hydrated soft and silky to the touch and no longer coarse and unmanageable just note that this is product is only meant to be part of a good hair care routine so you can t expect spectacular results by just using it on its own my only gripe is that i wish this came in a squeeze tube but other than that this is awesome 
2013-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|so i had gotten my hair done i had asked for highlights and the woman who dyed my hair ended up bleaching it the bleach really damaged my hair as it is not very thick and my hair is pretty dry fast forward i recently had my hair redone after months of letting it grow out and my new hairdresser said that my hair is pretty dry and that i should use a deep conditioner so i went to my local cvs and found this organix moroccan oil deep conditioning stuff it doesn t work at all i followed the directions completely shower cap hot towel etc when i rinsed it out it made my hair feel like it was dryer then when i initially put it in it made my hair really dry looking my ends are really frizzy and it made my hair really knotted and hard to brush through also it smelled really really nice in jar but on my hair i can barely smell anything i ve used organix products before and i ve never had an issue but this is the worst hair product especially deep conditioner that i have ever used 
2013-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|this review is for the conditioner the brand name organix is misleading this thing is full of chemicals it made my hair smell like chemicals the day after i wash my hair the price is way to high for the quality there are way better options in term of price and quality 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|it s an alright product nothing special kind of weighs my hair down the smell is amazing though 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i have a lot of naturally curly hair but it is fine coarse amp color treated i have been using all forms of argan oil products on it for about 8 years i started with the original moroccanoil but the price was just outrageous for the amount of product and i needed to find something more affordable i have tried everything under the sun but just could not find something comparable to the original i randomly stumbled upon this cheap little walmart find and it works as well if not better than it s ridiculously expensive competitor i know the actual amount of argan oil in it is minimal but it works so well in my hair what does it matter the only thing i can recommend is to use a clarifying shampoo once a week to get out any build up i apply this to towel dried damp hair and then brush it through then i either let it dry naturally for a shiny bouncy curly style or i blow dry it and flat iron it it is so versatile that it works amazing no matter what i do to style it 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i haven t tried the shampoo or conditioner but i am in love with the hair oil here s a good tip for all hair types mix a little bit of the hair oil with your normal conditioner not a deep conditioner hair mask and leave it in your hair for about 5 minutes and then wash it out you ll feel the difference in your after one wash while mixing the oil in my hair feel so smooth and soft up to 5 days for extra moisture apply a pea size amount to your hair after the shower this oil is amazing and leaves my hair shiny and smooth 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|thr is ok for my think not very shiny hair i was expecting a bit more i was hoping for a very creamy conditioner that left my hair less frizzy but it was no different from a basic supermarket conditioner like suave 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|love it must try it keeps my ringlets from getting frizzy
2013-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i don t find this treatment as good as the macadamia oil hair mask that organix makes 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|this thing smells really good it definitely makes hair feel smoother and for the price it s awesome it makes a difference in my hair for the day but it s never lasting like some high end stuff i d rather spend money on a pricier item that works my hair more would recommend if you are in need of a cheap hair treatment but wouldn t re purchase 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|loved the smell and texture of this treatment my hair felt soft after just a few uses i did not notice an improvement in split ends or breakage but my hair did feel nice after just using it i put a small amount in hands and coat my ends in it does not make hair greasy fyi 
2013-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i had high hopes for this conditioner i will never buy it agian i ve never been so disappointed with a conditioner before i do have the oil and dry oil spray of this line and both worked fine but this conditioner is horrible i used this only once but with conditioners i know after one wash if it improves my hair actually while your washing the conditioner out of your hair you just know if it works by the texture of your hair i put a good amount of this conditioner in my hair only from the ears down focusing on my ends of course i felt like the product evaporated or something felt like there was nothing in my hair i even put a bit more in my hair and it felt the same i let it sit in my hair for a minute and rinsed it out and it felt no different from before i put the conditioner it did not soften my hair didn t detangle it didn t feel silky it felt like it dried my hair out any and all conditioners i have tried have at least made my hair feel silky and soft didn t matter what brand this conditioner was a true disappointment mind you after i washed this conditioner out i put some of my clear scalp amp hair therapy conditioner in because my hair didn t feel conditioned my hair was very difficult to brush through while blow drying after using this the price point of these conditioners are high for drugstore but i figured i d try it after having the other moroccon argan oil products of the line do yourself a favour and do not purchase this 
2013-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i like this better than one n only argon oil but i don t feel like it does much for my hair i also feel like it leaves a tint on my blonde hair which i don t like i like my hair to feel silky smooth and nourished this just feels like its coating my hair without the moisture wouldn t repurchase 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]| organix is a drugstore hair care line that offers a huge selection of products this brand has always appealed to me but i never grabbed anything from them a while ago i caved and bought the moroccan argan oil intense moisturizing treatment organix says this product will quot renew your hair s inner health with argan oil nutrients antioxidants and vitamin e organix renewing moroccan argan oil intense moisturizing treatment is a deep conditioning exotic formula to add brilliant shine and create lush softness without leaving any heavy residue that can weigh hair down quot not surprisingly this product contains very little argan oil but that doesn t keep organix from making some big claims on the trendy ingredient s behalf organix claims that their renewing moroccan argan oil line contains quot a unique precious blend of moroccan argan oil which instantly penetrates the hair shaft restoring shine and softness while strengthening and creating soft seductive and silky perfection quot i got my 8fl oz 237 ml tub at ulta for free on a bogo deal i believe it regularly retails for about 7 organix is a total misnomer there isn t anything organic about this brand but at least it s cruelty free this hair treatment was made in america i think the thing that most appeals to me about organix is their packaging it s really vibrant and eye catching and i like the way each line of products is color coordinated the renewing moroccan argan oil intense moisturizing treatment comes in a recyclable oval shaped sky blue tub topped with a gold lid the tub is covered with information the front of the tube features the product name organix logo and a description of the formula the back of the tub offers a longer description directions and a full ingredient list good job organix its not every day a company creates good looking informative packaging organix intense moisturizing treatment is a dense but not overly thick off white cream organix recommends smoothing or combing a small amount through wet hair applying it from root to tip for best results you re instructed to cover your hair with a towel or shower cap for me and my thick tangly hair i rub about half a palmful through my hair and twist it up with a clip leaving it in for roughly 5 8 minutes organix recommends 3 5 minutes the renewing moroccan argan oil intense moisturizing treatment can be a little stubborn to rinse out it really bonds to the hair once rinsed out i notice an immediate difference in my hair this treatment is excellent for detangling it undoes my most stubborn knots with absolutely no effort this product really seems to deep condition my hair softening it and keeping it silky and shiny without adding any weight to my hair i follow up with the matching weightless healing dry oil to really seal the moisture in by the way organix moroccan argan oil line smells great it has a sexy musky floral scent that clings to the hair organix moroccan argan oil intense moisturizing treatment is a nice hair mask to use once a week or so i prefer a straight up hair oil but this will do in a pinch i really love how well organix treatment detangles and keeps my hair silky this product has never weighted my hair down or made my hair or scalp oily plus it makes my hair smell great i recommend organix intense moisturizing treatment if you have dry or easily tangled hair this product truly lives up to it s claims and i can really appreciate that i won t repurchase this product right away but i can definitely see myself grabbing another tub one day and i ll definitely be trying more from organix 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|oil recommended by my cousin i decided to try this product my hair is dry due to the colour perm and uv here in summer i applied a bit on my hair after blow dry my hair feels silky and smooth it is amazing i do recommend it 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|my hair was so damaged from bleaching and highlighting but after using this products my dry and brittle hair has transformed into soft hydrated and silky 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|this is for the tub which i tried and returned i just remember being surprised how little i liked it i pretty much am convinced that argan oil isn t the oil for me because of these products with it that just don t do a thing having luck with other oils more i did try the spray of organix argan and it seems ok but also has cocoa and shea in it which my hair loves oh well 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i have been hearing a lot of things about argan oil and when i saw this kit on costco i had to tried it came with shampoo conditioner and leave in oil my hair is soft shiny frizz less and with so much more volume even my natural light brown and red highlights are more noticeable i cannot understand the bad reviews on this at all i have naturally curly hair that i straighten with brazilian keratin and this works great my hair is fine and tend to get oily easily with heavy products and this did not weighed down my hair in any way it gave me amazing swish hair love it 
2012-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|this review is for the conditioner not the treatment i have dry hair very fine but lots of it it is naturally curly but i blow dry it 2 or 3 times a week i have received a shampoo as a gift called agadir argan oil shampoo i could not find the conditioner from this brand so i bought the organix moroccan argan oil conditioner i am surprised about all the bad reviews this conditioner works fine for me it makes my hair soft clean does not way it down it it not the best ever but it is also not the worst i find that my hair looks healthier and more lively 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|ugh my sister told me to get this she said it worked great on her bleached hair so i went out and bought 2 jars of the stuff when cvs was having a sale first of all this is not a good product it s supposed to be this intense treatment and it s not even that moisturizing i ve used 99 conditioners that were more moisturizing than this i liked the smell at first but it gets kind of sicking it s very very strong and lingers you waste so much of this product because it s in a tub and its hard to gauge how much you need to grab i used to love this brand but i m not sure why because lately i ve been noticing their products are garbage the only thing i ve ever really liked is that their sulfate free shampoos smell relatively nice which is rare for shampoos lacking fillers 
2012-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|im very into natural sulfate free hair treatments when i saw this at walgreens i thought i would give it a try maybe i did the treatment wrong but it did absolutely nothing for my hair the smell was heavenly though thats why i am giving it 2 stars 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i expect a conditioner to leave my hair soft and tangle free i have fine hair that only needs a little conditioner normally this product didn t detangle didn t leave hair softer and left it frizzy trying to run a comb through my damp hair after was almost impossible and would pull out big chunks of tangled hair i would never ever buy it again 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|argan oil it weighs my hair a bit down i do put it at some of my breakage that is short and near my scalp and i don t get those annoying short flyaways that stick straight up anymore it feels heavy but yet it makes my hair soft completely comb through and manageable my hair w out this is extra dry poofy and frizzy no split ends my hair now has great moisture after flat iron or my in styler i love this product this and my in styler are coming with me to my grave or urn lol i have tried frizzease s extra strength serum and it totally fails compared to this argan oil treatment cream i deep conditioned with it for 30 minutes just used a plastic bag and covered my hair tightly with it using a clip did a few chores and it warmed up my head so that s a good thing washed it off i noticed it wasn t the kind that leaves smooth residue it felt more like i could start feeling my individual hair strands for once while i was rinsing it i will use this once a week in conjunction with the oil that i will use everyday 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i really like this stuff i have weird hair i haven t colored it and i literally heat style like once a year and it still continues to be dry and kind of foofy and frizzy and this doesn t completely eliminate it but it makes my hair feel really soft and it s much easier to brush through while wet it just feels really nice on your hair and it works the longer you have to leave it in the better it works so make sure you wait at least 3 minutes to rinse it out 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i have never in my 49 years ever written a review on any product but i was so blown away by this product i even registered on this site to write a review wish i had a before n after pic no woman in the world has worse hair than mine it s dry frizzy brittle over processed sun scorched you name it my hair is also extremely damaged from flat ironing it but i have no choice but to keep using it because thats how bad my hair is yesterday i applied this to dry hair and left it in for about an hour then shampooed and washed it out today my hair is soft bouncy shiny frizz free and looks amazing my 13 yr old son is addicted to the shampoo i noticed someone was using it when it was done to nothing and got a deal buy 1 get 1 so i decided to dry this in the past month i have tried about 9 different products this one rates a 10 and beyond 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i am in love with the moroccan deep conditioning treatment i bought the deep treatment conditioner the one that comes in the container not the regular shampoo conditioner i left this on overnight for a deep conditioning mask and i love love love the way my hair feels today the frizz is reduced a lot and its a lot smoother than yesterday the texture feels so fine today i will continue using this product until they stop making it 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i was looking for a good deep conditioner for awhile i think i first noticed this product because of the cute blue color it comes in i picked it up and smelled it it smelt wonderful so i purchased it and went home after one use i could notice a difference in how my dry very curly hair felt so much softer i love this and will continue to use forever i m hooked 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i recently did some damage to my hair did my own ombre and i really like how it turned out bui don t like how it left my hair feeling lightening does damage been using this once a week now for 3 weeks and it really brought moisture back to my hair i can really tell the difference and i love it i leave it in for about 5 10 minutes and if i feel like my hair is in super need i will leave in for 30 minutes this is super affordable about 8 a tub for a good amount of product def will repurchase 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i don t know why there are some bad reviews maybe because i have thin hair i have very fine and thin hair but i use heat styling tools daily and it gets dry i used this mask and it made my hair so soft without adding and weight to it i love this it really made my hair feel soft and moisturized without feeling greasy i also used this alone with a different shampoo and conditioner just as a leave in after and rinsed after about 5 minutes

2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|what a load of silicone this made my hair so heavy and just urgh don t know what all the hype is about on this brand i know argan oil is good for hair but this brand totally ruins it for people i know it s a bad product because i later got the pro naturals moroccan argan oil and it was much better no silicones not heavy not greasy and it s also a heat protectant so yeah sticking with them from now on 
2012-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|hmm i have some pretty mixed feelings about this treatment i bought this not too long after learning about the benefits of using oil on my hair and i was really excited about it at first i thought it was pretty moisturizing and beneficial to my hair but after using it for a few months a jar goes a really long way i don t feel that i get the same results anymore i took a month s break from it and tried again but i still felt that my hair needed more moisture which is odd since it s straight fine and isn t really chemically treated i did give it to my sister though and she adores it hopefully she won t experience the same quot burn out quot that i did 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i am kinda shocked at all the bad reviews here i m not sure what s going on for my hair this was literally a miracle no less i have been quot blessed quot with very frizzy uncontrollable dull mess of a curly mop you would not wish on your enemies i hope if i want to look presentable i have to either straighten it or dump industrial quantities of mousse on and pray for no humidity weather my drawer boasts an impressive collection of hair products i have tried in the past and non had more than a negligible affect a week ago last tuesday i bought the moroccan argan oil renewing treatment and i have used it every night since after the first use i already noticed an incredible difference my curls looked defined soft and shiny more than they ever have and it has been getting only better since the difference is that between a mess that makes me want to hide and hair i can walk around with and feel good about i wouldn t say life changing because this is only hair but pretty damn close something on the scale of switching from glasses to lenses i can see it didn t work for allot of people and i m confused the fact is it worked incredibly well for me maybe this only works for a specific kind of hair i don t think i have ever been this excited about a product i do have some issues with the packaging the amount of product in the tub is way too small i have used almost half of it in one week i also don t think the consistency is good it s little too liquidly but those are external things i m more than ready to ignore for the results i ve gotten 
2012-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|this product reminded me of why i turned to mua without its product review guidance i make bad choices my hair needs a trim and with winter too it is a bit dry and lacklustre i was unimpressed at how my pot wasn t totally full even though i chose one from the back of the shelf but i shrugged it off it went on feeling rich and heavy and i left it on for the recommended amount of time but when i rinsed it out my hair felt like i had just used a normal conditioner not some quot renewing quot treatment when i was blow drying my hair it felt like it had a weird texture and i am sure it looked duller i would have been unhappy if this had cost me 4 let alone 16aud which it cost my hair is not dyed or chemically processed nor do i heat style on a regular basis so there is no reason why this did not work except that it s a terrible product the points are for scent and a slight increase in volume i will use it as a regular conditioner so it isn t a complete waste of money but i will never again buy it 
2012-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i ve been trying to grow out my dry frizzy dyed hair so my sister gave me this to try i ve never done a mask or deep condition to my hair so i can t really compare this to others but i really do like this product it doesn t leave my hair feeling oily but it does feel moisturized and the frizz has decreased dramatically i did read the ingredients and it contains jojoba oil so i added a couple more drops of my organic jojoba oil to the mix and it made my hair soft shinny without frizz and very manageable it smells really good and i don t have to use a lot of product a little goes a long way with this stuff i didn t wrap the towel around my head that s just a lot of work i just left it on for a few minutes in the shower and rinsed off my split ends are a little less noticeable and i m hoping the frizz doesn t come back towards the end of the day cute little blue bottle 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i was not impressed by this product i heard a ton of good things about moroccan argan oil and so i decided to give this product a try since i love organix s cherry shine spray i was extremely disappointed this didn t moisturize at all and my hair didn t even detangle a little in order to get it to slightly detangle my hair i had to slather on a bunch of the stuff the scent was pretty but it didn t work for me my hair is moderately damaged though maybe it would work better on undamaged hair will stick with my aussie 3 minute miracle treatment 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|just a bunch of silicone diddnt do anything but coat the hair biosilk is much better at what this attempts to do go get the real argan oil its better than this stuff 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|it smells really good and comes in the cutest packaging but unfortunately it doesn t work very well even as a regular conditioner even when i use heaps of this in my hair it hardly feels like it s coating it enough it doesn t make my hair any easier to detangle like regular conditioner does as far as hydrating it i haven t noticed a difference either i ll continue to use it until it s gone but i wouldn t buy it again even if it was 50 cents 
2011-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i do not recommend this it weighed down my hair but also left it extremely dry it wasn t moisturizing at all 
2011-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i wanted this to be the drugstore version of higher end deep repair mask but i was not impressed i liked the smell but the product itself didn t seem to moisturize my hair as well as my conditioner by sauve that is only 2 00 does it left my hair shiny after drying but did nothing to prevent tangles or make it soft will not be repurchasing 
2011-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|this leaves my hair smooth and supple i have long curly naturally dry hair that craves lots and lots of moisture i bought this because i was attracted to its promise of undoing lots of damage and creating supple hair it is extremely thick and after i rinsed it out i felt that my hair was moisturized and restored perfectly i wish that the package contained more product i m a hair product experimenter i wouldn t immediately go back and buy this but if i was ever in a pinch i know i could go for this one 
2011-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|all i can say is that i did not like this product at all i have curly hair and my hair type is a 3c i need producs that have a lot of moisure in them being that i have dry hair well i am a big fan of argan oil i use it in my hair regimen so when i seen this product i was very excited to purchase and try it the first time i tried it i was very disappointed i had washed and conditioned my hair then i applied this product as a deep conditioner i use a shower cap on my hair and sat under the dryer for about 10 minutes after rinsing out this product out of my hair my hair felt worst then i did before i had applied the product i am very upset and would not reccommend this product to anyone wih curly hair hat tends to get dry 
2011-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i love this treatment i makes my hair super soft shiney and smooth i have used hair treatments from just about every brand out there and this is the best hg 
2011-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i bought the oil and the mask at a buy one get one free at target i was wanting to try some type of moroccon product so this was perfect first thing that brought my atn was the smell it smelled delicious anyway long story short i use the oil after every hair was a long with a chi leave in conditioner and the hair mask about once of twice a week and my hair is super soft dyed hair about 3 weeks ago 
2011-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|beware to anyone with sensitive skin that is breakout prone i have tried this product and the cherry shampoo and both caused a reaction that i ended up going to the doc for i had low to mild grade folliculitis on the sides of my face and jaw for months before i figured out it was triggered by a product i was prescribed antibiotics and oral steroids to clear up the problem but neither made a lasting difference after the problem persisted i made a second doc visit this time he told me i was probably having a reaction to something i was using in my skincare or haircare and to remember what i was using before i started having these problems he gave me a shot for inflammation and prescribed attarax for the irritation i switched to head and shoulders and went back to the giovanni organics conditioner i had used in the past i have not figured out what ingredient or ingredients don t agree with my skin so i am just going to stay away from the whole line 
2011-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|wow i loveeeeee this line of products i bought it because i bleached my hair and it was totallly damaged i used thiss for a whileee and it works sooooooo gooood and i cantt even begin to talk about the smelll i could use it as body wash thats how goood it smells
2011-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|my hair type mostly straight but when i air dry it it can have waves gets a little oily and greasy at the roots on the second day i am very active therefore i sweat a lot and it gets dirty so i wash it frequently no split ends little breakage occasional frizz fly aways poofyness generally healthy hair i was in the market for a deep conditioner at cvs the other day and decided to pick up the organix renewing moroccan oil intense moisturizing treatment the one in the little blue tub i ve been interested in companies that include a lot of natural ingredients in their products so i decided to give the organix brand a try i ve heard what great things moroccan oil aka argan oil can do for your hair i ve got to say this stuff makes my hair silky smooth and incredibly shiny i ve only used it twice now so it s probably a little early for a review but i can tell you that it really does work i don t have especially dry hair in fact it can get a little oily i m quite an active person and therefore sweat and my hair gets dirty greasy i just wanted something that would keep it nice and healthy i was a little confused on how this is meant to be used but this is how i do it once a week after i ve shampooed and conditioned i take a scoop of this stuff and work it through my hair i brush it before i get in the shower and then finger comb it through i leave it in for 5 minutes and rinse with cool to luke warm water as directed i haven t tried the shower cap and hot towel method as the directions say it seems like too much mess work for me but i ll eventually do it my hair is incredibly smooth and silky right after i use this product it s a great deep conditioner for already healthy hair the bright blue packaging is eye catching and cute it s 7 well spent 
2011-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|for some reason i like this product better as a daily conditioner than a deep treatment when i use it in the shower it makes my hair very soft in a short amount of time used for over an hour as a mask my hair is a bad combination of slighty dry and limp 
2011-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|okay so i was in the dominican republic for the month of august and my hair got so dry and brittle from wetting it everyday at the beach pool river etc i decided to purchase this entire line organix morrocan to help repair my hair i am soooooooo disappointed these products made my hair sooooooo much more dry and damaged i wanted to cry the first time i used it i couldn t believe how much this thing effed up my hair my hair is curly and long i only needed something to give it moisture and this product made my hair worse than when i started i dont recommend this product for latina curly hair the price is not bad and the packaging isnt either but the product itself sucks 
2011-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil Renewing Treatment [DISCONTINUED (reformulated)]|i just used this this morning i didn t go with the shower cap amp hot towel method rather i just tied up my hair and my hair is now soft and smooth and there seem to be a little less frizz than usual definitely a nice treatment mask for the price i believe i paid about 7 at my local cvs 
2017-08|1.0|Heavenly Hydration Cherry Blossom Shampoo|bought this as an impulse buy after smelling it and believing it was organic and natural then get home and read the ingredients ogx is a bogus product that even was sued for false advertising the ingredients are crap tons of sulfates parabens and silicones tossed it away and never ever will buy an ogx product beware ladies http www asrcreviews org nad recommends vogue change product names for certain shampoos conditioners 
2016-08|1.0|Heavenly Hydration Cherry Blossom Shampoo|to be honest i mainly bought this for the smell and didn t have high expectations that it would do anything for my hair i was right it did absolutely nothing for my hair in fact it was more drying than i expected i have no idea why they describe it as a hydrating shampoo not only that but the scent does not last at all i couldn t even smell at all it once i got out of the shower which i wouldn t have cared about if it worked decently and made my hair feel moisturized but it definitely doesn t which was surprising considering it s sulphate free i m surprised how much these products disappointed me 
2015-08|1.0|Heavenly Hydration Cherry Blossom Shampoo|i wanted to like this shampoo but aside from the heavenly cherry scent loved that i couldn t believe how much i disliked it it lathers really well but it felt like my hair kept sticking to my finger nails which is really odd i ve never had a shampoo do this before i got my nails done 4 days ago and there is no reason for this weird sticky feeling from the shampoo i don t feel like it was hydrating more like it was stripping my hair of moisture because it was also a real order trying to brush through my hair afterward i used the companion conditioner as well one thing to mention about the packaging it may look nice but it s extremely difficult to get the product out of the bottle i can see a lot of waste by not being able to get it all out when you are near the end although i may not even bother trying to be honest i think i paid 8 99 on sale for the shampoo and in my opinion it isn t worth even 1 99 this one was an all around disappointment for me 
2015-08|4.0|Heavenly Hydration Cherry Blossom Shampoo|i have both the shampoo and conditioner for this scent and so far so good my favorite thing about this product is the scent it is a wonderful cherry blossom scent it s more of a pure cherry blossom scent than the ginseng and cherry blossom one from the same company and it s not as woody or musky as some quot japanese cherry blossom quot type scents can be i m thinking mainly of the japanese cherry blossom scent from bath and body works on top of having a nice scent this shampoo and conditioner has wonderful lasting power i washed my hair almost 48 hours ago and i still get nice wafts of the scent when my hair moves and the scent is very present when i actually go to sniff the hair and in addition to that i have even put products in my hair after washing it and the cherry blossom scent shines through i love it i have read other reviews of this product saying that it s not as hydrating as some of the other ogx shampoos and conditioners as well as lamenting the fact that there s not some sort of serum with a matching scent for those two concerns what i can say is that i haven t noticed the shampoo or conditioner being particularly lacking in moisturizing qualities however i often do coconut oil hair masks on my hair because of previous bleach damage so that could be a part of it but this shampoo and conditioner is moisturizing enough for my needs and as far as a serum or oil goes i ve been using the coconut water dry oil from ogx as well as the occasional argan oil treatment and i ve always been able to smell the scent of this shampoo even through the scent of the other products it is very persistent 
2017-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|works well to condition without weighing down my hair i love the fact that it has no sulfates or oils some people hate the scent but i love it and it lasts all day i have a ton of conditioners but this is the one i reach for most often 
2016-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|this stuff is the shit literally a friend suggested this for my curls they re frizzy ad pretty limp sometimes i needed product that would pick them up easily it took my a bottle of this to realise but it left my curls not so bouncy which is okay but made them shine reduced breakage and really minimised frizz and notting so incredible the smell took awhile to get used to but it s 100 repurchase for me the best out of all their products thus far 
2016-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|been using this for about a month now and i really like it the scent is quite strong so please smell before you buy because it s going to stay with you it s a clean ocean type scent that i really love interesting consistency on this the conditioner is more of a shampoo consistency more clear and the shampoo seems like a thicker cream anyway both work quite well this conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny but not weighed down would repurchase 
2015-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|the sea mineral moisture is so far my favourite conditioner by organix my hair is a bit fine and the lengths tend to be a little dry with my roots getting a bit greasy but this conditioner along with the matching shampoo has nourished my hair very well when i came back from holiday my hair had become quite parched in the sun and this really helped to restore and smooth it my hair feels so much more hydrated but not weighed down the formula is creamy and light but not overwhelming for my hair type would repurchase 
2015-08|2.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|initially i really liked this conditioner it is at a very affordable price point and i love the packaging and the scent it worked fine at first but after using it for a while i noticed how frizzy and dry my hair was becoming i don t heat style my hair anymore but this conditioner did terrible things to my ends it made it seem like all i d done with straighten my ends over and over in terms of the dryness and frazzled look i also noticed that it made my scalp so dry that i got dandruff it made my scalp itch and flake like crazy i also at one point tried washing my makeup brushes with this they ended up slightly stiffer than they used to be i also tried using this as a shaving cream when i ran out for a brief period it made my legs so dry that they looked grey and this is coming from someone who is tan all year round overall i would not recommend this conditioner however ogx makes some other conditioners that i really love like the coconut curls conditioner 
2015-08|2.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|bought this with the sea mineral moisture shampoo and deep conditioner and used all 3 products up within 2 months of purchasing the products from this line smell incredible like mixed alcoholic drinks and they do leave my hair feeling soft touchable and with just enough volume and control my hair won t oil up until i go a 2nd day in a row without washing my hair however with this conditioner specifically it would take literally a handful of conditioner to get my hair to feel soft and actually conditioned and even then this did not yield its promise of taming split ends an unusually huge problem i had out of nowhere just prior to purchasing this system sure this calls for a trim but after that i ll be trying a different conditioner also if i were to ever repurchase a conditioner from this line again and simply because it takes a lot of product to get results from any organix hair care line in my experience i would skip this conditioner and just get 2 tubes of the deep conditioner which actually has almost exactly the same ingredient list as the regular conditioner except for maybe 4 things and it s only 8oz of product i think it yields much softer hair but split ends are still rampant such a disappointment organix yet again 
2015-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|i love this conditioner it leaves my hair soft and full i adore the scent too i have fine straight thick waist length hair 
2014-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|i have used the shampoo and conditioner for awhile now and even on my second set the smell is interesting it has a very fresh and clean type of scent that will remind you of ocean but without the salt i can t exactly describe it but i really do like it the shampoo definitely cleanses my scalp and every strand but the conditioner does not de frizz my hair enough when i flat iron it after using these products it s smooth with no frizz but naturally my dry ends will float away from my head giving that weird teased look as if i don t know how to brush my hair if you have damaged hair or split ends try doing two conditioning sessions and let it sit a while and definitely invest in some oil treatment i use moroccan oil light treatment http www moroccanoil com usa h_us_en moroccanoil treatment light 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|i am blonde with color treated parts in my hair my hair is very thin and damages super easy this conditioner definitely moisturizes without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy the smells is a little strong and earthy which is my only drawback for this product 
2014-08|3.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|i love a lot of the organix conditioners but this one just didn t make the cake for me my hair is thick and damaged so i need a very moisturizing and healing conditioner it seems like the organix conditioners that are thinner in consistency like this one or argan oil cremã cannot deliver enough moisture for me the smell is nice and beachy though which is why this gets a three for me if you have thick hair i would recommend the argan oil conditioner 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|amazing i love the shampoo hydrating mist and moisture surge treatment as well from this entire sea mineral line i ve tried other products from organix in the past and ew everything i have tried was horrible and dried out my hair but this line this is completely different and amazing hydrates my hair like never before i will repurchase definitely 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|love it i use it with the shampoo the smell is delicious 
2014-08|2.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|this is probably the only ogx shampoo with good reviews anywhere i tried it because of the rave reviews because i love love ogx moroccan argan curling cream for styling my somewhat wavy oily scalp dry ends hair and because i got it on sale at walgreens for 6 i was especially intrigued by one reviewer noting it helped her itchy irritated scalp the first night i used it i really liked it the smell is odd like a muffled beach salt smell i like the smell of their argan and biotin line better but it was a good middle ground between moisturizing and clarifying shampoos my hair felt soft and not weighed down when it dried though nexxus keraphix conditioner may have more to do with that it wasn t squeaky dry clean like the irritating tea tree shampoo from ogx it was nice however after 2 3 uses i noticed my scalp acne or painful bumps coming back i have three cyst like inflamed painful bumps on the left side of my scalp and the rest of my scalp itches this has glycol distearate the ingredient that makes shampoos pearlescent that s been said to cause acne and irritation in many people same for algae extract which though i take these ratings with a large grain if salt ranks 5 5 on comedogenicity rating scales i m not sure which ingredient or combination thereof is responsible but i ll have to take this back i have also noticed a bit more breakage which to be fair may be from my weekly suave clarifying shampoo but it s too much to risk it dang their styling products are pretty good but i ve had no luck with their shampoos 
2014-08|5.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|i get dandruff so i have a difficult time finding hair care that moisturizes my very long very thick hair without weighing it down and contributing to my dandruff this line does just that it leaves my hair soft ridiculously shiny light and bouncy and plays up the subtle wave in my hair best of all i m not getting dandruff scent is subjective but i personally love the beachy smell and think it is a nice alternative to strong floral perfume and citrus scents 
2013-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|i don t think this is the conditioner that will become my usual conditioner but it is my favorite from the organix line so far i like how the conditioner works its rich and leaves my hair shiny yet not weighed down my issues with it are the smell and the packaging the scent smells good on first whiff but it is a heavy scent that lingers by the end of the night it was making me slightly sick the bottle is another issue its very cute but because this conditioner is so thick the thick plastic bottle makes it very difficult once the bottle is half empty to get any out i really need both hands to squeeze it and that doesn t work when i have to squeeze the product into one hand overall a good product though 
2013-08|4.0|Sea Mineral Conditioner|my local walgreens was having a bogo sale on organix and i saw that this was new i loved the light teal colored bottle and i noticed that this has a pretty high glycerine level so it would be perfect for me to use in the summer the smell is not my favorite though it has a very generic lime like smell and it lingers the good thing is that this gives good slip and shine the sea kelp and sea mineral extracts are in the middle of the ingredient list and i think it did a pretty good job of moisturizing my hair i have yet to try the kukui conditioner to see if i like that one better it does give a bit of weight to my hair without pulling my curls as much although i am not sure how it performs with the matching shampoo organix has surprisingly worked well for my hair in the past so i would say if you do well in general with the line it wouldn t hurt to try it out i will have to update on its performance in the summer to see how well it holds up for me 
2016-08|2.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|bought this for my 12 year old s long slightly dry very thick hair nope fail made her a frizz bomb 
2012-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i purchased the conditioner to use with the shea shampoo and used them both together and with different shampoos and each time i got the same result comparing this conditioner to the organix coconut condition the shea formula was a lot less thick i like my conditioners to be thick and creamy and this was not this product did not help smooth my hair or make it more manageable the scent was nice but i did not find that it lingered like the coconut version did not get desirable results so i will not repurchase 
2011-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|this conditioner made my face break out i have combination skin but usually don t get pimples so this stuff definitely caused problems it conditioned my hair however so i can t give it a zero 
2011-08|2.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|first off the brand name is misleading this is just as quot organic quot as every other shampoo out there that has fruit of some sort as an ingredient so basically all of them it s still loaded with sulfates and alcohols so if you re looking for a more natural product this isn t it i was given this awhile back along with the shampoo and i gave it a few months since hair needs time to adjust to new products and i figured this might work better after a few weeks like other products i ve tried instead it s just been worse and worse since i started using it it s to the point now where combing my short not even chin length hair is a painful time consuming process and it feels rough and a little frizzy afterwards that being said it does moisturize my hair without making it oily which is nice for combination hair like mine sadly i won t be rebuying since the benefits aren t worth ripping out chunks of hair every time i wash and brush it 
2011-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i got both the shampoo and conditioner at a local closeout store for about 3 a piece i wanted to use an organic product because i had used giovanni line and loved it but they were too expensive i ve noticed my hair is really nasty lately it is almost impossible to run a comb through and my hair has never been tangled or hard to brush and it dries very weird and leaves spots that feel unclean or have residue on them i am using a some other hair products so today i tried just the organix shampoo and conditioner to see if it was them i don t have a problem with the shampoo and my hair seems to feel nice after using it and it smells good the conditioner though doesn t cover well i have short hair and i have to use so much just to cover all my head i let it sit for a few minutes like i do with my conditioners so it soaks up then when i rinsed it out my hair felt almost sticky it was hard to run my fingers through and didn t feel conditioned at all i am very disappointed with this product but i may continue to use the shampoo since it made my hair feel silkier than the conditioner did 
2011-08|2.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i purchased this because i liked the list of ingredients which included jojoba seed oil whipped yogurt proteins silk mino acids panthenol avocado oil vitamin e glycerin and of course shea butter looked liked a lot of quot good stuff quot packed into that little bottle smelled nice so i m surprised that this made my hair feel the opposite of smooth quot gritty quot and quot crunchy quot even while still wet i usually comb out my shoulder length hair while still wet with conditioner and noticed this wasn t as easy to do as with others i ve used before i had to tug to get the comb through my straight hair sorry to say back this goes 
2011-08|5.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i purchased this after hearing basically a mix bag of reviews i heard that organix line is the best and i also heard it was horrid i decided to go ahead and purchase this let s start out with information about my hair i do not dye my hair nor use lots of chemicals nor use lots of heat appliances on it my first purchase among the organix line was the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and brazilian keratin therapy shampoo and conditioner and this organix shea butter smoothing shampoo and the conditioner are my holy grail this stuff actually tames my minor frizz and makes it smell so wonderful the shampoo one is a bit more drying than the other shampoos in the organix line but once you condition your hair it comes out silky and smooth overall my verdict is to definitely try the shea butter smoothing line of products you won t be disapointed 
2011-08|5.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|why such bad reviews on this this is my hg conditioner i love every product from the organix line this conditioner is smoothing and smells so yummy my hair feels smoother after i use it information about my hair not dyed all natural wavy curly thick and healthy i recommend atleast giving this product a try regardless of the mix of reviews 
2011-08|4.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i like this i have really curly hair 3c 4a it does a good job moisturizing it s also a good leave in or deep conditioner it s great for twists also 
2010-08|3.0|Shea Butter Conditioner| edit i was recently out of town and was using a different shampoo conditioner when i returned home and washed my hair with this i was disappointed to see how this left my hair weighed down and tangled compared to what i was using away from home the suave almond amp shea butter one in case you were wondering so i m tossing this and switching original review is below i use this with the corresponding shampoo my hair is thick with a fine texture i get a lot of flyaways and my hair is never quite as smooth as i want it also because it is winter i deal with two dueling hair conditions dry ends and greasy roots and bangs i wash my hair at night accordingly i like this conditioner for two reasons first it does help eliminate the dryness some but prevents my roots and bangs from being super greasy when i wake up in the morning two i feel like it keeps my hair really soft the smell and texture of the conditioner is great and the smell does linger in a good way all in all this works well enough for my hair though i m still seeking my hg smoothing product 
2010-08|4.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i like this product because it leaves my hair feeling soft and conditioned without letting it get weighed down which is good since my hair is almost to my waist now it has a nice smell that isn t too overpowering unlike the passionfruit guava one i also tried the only prob em i have with it is that since it is a thick formula it is a little hard to get out of the bottle once you use more than half of it i think that this is a great conditioner and will buy it again 
2010-08|2.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i ve previously used the coconut organix and should have learned my lesson while these products promise a lot and they do smell great and have cute packaging they just don t deliver the shea butter products seemed okay at first after shampooing my hair was extremely tangled and felt stripped but after the conditioner it felt silky and soft i didn t notice any particular quot smoothing quot ability though after about 2 weeks use my hair was dried out with frizz and i gave these to my husband to finish them up my hair tends to be somewhat dry and i only wash about twice a week these might be okay if you have oily hair and only wash once a week but if your hair is at all dry or has any damage avoid the shampoo strips your hair and the conditioner isn t hydrating enough to recover it won t repurchase 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|organix shampoos and conditioners were such a big disappointment for me i have used 3 different ones you think i d have learned my lesson after the first and they were all really terrible on my hair the reason for me is the conditioners are just not conditioning at all with the conditioner on my hair i couldn t get the comb through my hair it just seems they have no detangling or moisturising properties at all these products smell absolutely amazing and lure you in but i would not recommend any of them for people who like moist slippery conditioners that comb through well and leave the hair actually conditioned when dry i give this 1 lippie just for the smell alone 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|this conditioner did not counterbalance the damaging effects of the lines drying shampoo the conditioner also dries and tangled my hair even though i put a ridiculous amout of conditioner on i would definately not recomend this product to anyone this is an awful line of products 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i didn t care for this product it didn t do much for moisturizing or detangling my hair and i made sure to try it after i clarified and removed any other products or build up i thought i would love it since it was silicone free and the ingredients look great however when i used the conditioner with the shampoo nothing special 
2010-08|2.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i have very long hip length curly hair and am always on the lookout for a good moisturizing conditioner i don t have good luck with silicones i do not believe they are quot bad quot they just don t work for me i thought i d try this since it has shea butter when i used it it seemed thick and creamy but when my hair started to try it was clear it didn t do a good job of moisturizing the package is pretty small and the price is kind of steep for a drugstore hair product in such a small package it smells really good though i say that if you have good luck with silicones and don t mind the price give it a try the name for this brand is misleading it has a few natural ingredients but it s not predominately natural or organic i ve tried a few of the coconut products from this line too and although they smelled great they didn t work well for me 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|if you like your hair feeling like straw you ll love this product personally i don t mind you i don t have corse hair by any means staright to the garbage 
2010-08|5.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|as much as i didn t like the coconut conditioner of this brand this one is nice i know it has mixed reviews i think it just may be different hair types i have fine wavy hair that is damaged due to coloring and needs to be washed every other day after i used this my waves were soft and noticable for once not frizzy and dry plus it smells great i got it on clearance and bought a few bottles my co worker who has thick crazy curly hair didn t like this at all but she loves catwalk curl amplifier and i dont so again it s probably a matter of hair type
2009-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i really hated this like others have said no conditioning actually dried hair out completely tangled mess i had to use a massive amount of spray dentangler afterwards i m really disappointed and will be returning this don t be sucked in by the clever verbiage on the bottle and packaging 
2009-08|2.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i like the scent but that s about it this conditioner failed to protect my hair from the corresponding organix shea butter shampoo which dried my hair out completely i ll probably pair this up with a better shampoo to finish it up then wash my hands of organix forever 
2009-08|4.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i got this on a buy one get one free at walgreens i decided to buy the coconut conditioner along with this one as a trial to the line i was impressed just like the coconut conditioner this smells great also it is so think and creamy another plus it makes my hair feel so silky and soft just like with the coconut conditioner i go back and forth between using this as a daily conditioner or occasionally using a dollop about dime sized as a leave in it works great for both it is a bit expensive for a drugstore brand especially for the size of the bottle but totally worth it the only other downside is that the bottle is kind of awkward to hold and can slip out of your hand kind of easily other than that great buy 
2009-08|4.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i really like the conditioner the smell is yummyyyy and i bought it because i heard it s good for curly hairr and it iss i love it 
2009-08|2.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|this conditioner is bad the smell is fantastic and does leave your hair smelling great all day after i rinse it out my hair feels dry and tangly even though i run a wide tooth comb through my hair with the conditioner in it my hair does not tangle easily so for this to occur i know the conditioner must be bad i may try mixing it with another conditioner based on other reviews just for the scent 
2009-08|4.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|this product smells great and does a good job of helping to smooth my hair out it does a nice job of conditioning but when i want extra moisture i mix it with the organix coconut deep conditioner and it works quite well 
2008-08|4.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|this conditioner smelt delicious i washed my hair with brocatto cloud 9 shampoo and used this conditioner it wasn t the most hydrating conditioner so i paired it with herbal essences none of your frizziness leave in conditioner before i dryed my hair the smell alone is worth it i would buy this product again just because of how inexpensive it is this product definately isn t my favorite though 
2008-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|this conditioner smells amazing but does not work whatsoever after shampooing my hair with the organix shea butter shampoo which was decent i applied a normal amt of this conditioner i was excited at first because the consistency is so thick amp creamy which in my experience is a great sign in a conditioner much to my disappointment the conditioner disappeared after application no joke it sunk right into my hair leaving my hair feeling totally dry i thought that maybe either i didn t add enough or because it was so thick that it didn t spread all over so i tried adding more nope that just sunk in too worst conditioner ever bummer because the pretty scent lasts all day amp i kept getting compliments on how nice my hair smelled 
2008-08|4.0|Shea Butter Conditioner| by no means my favorite conditioner but it is most definitely a good one especially considering the price the fragrance is also heavenly yum 
2008-08|1.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i bought and used this about a year ago it is very drying and not moisturizing at all the more i used it along wit the matching shampoo the dryer my hair became so i gave it to my sis after a week cause she has much shorter hair and i figured it would probably work for her but one use and she tossed it sucks cause it smells heavenly and the bottles are gorgeous 
2008-08|5.0|Shea Butter Conditioner|i really like the smell of this conditioner and how thick it is it smells kind of like coconut suntan oil it smooths over the hair easily my hair was pretty easy to detangle afterwards would definitely buy again 
2016-08|1.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo|sorry but this did not work at all for me i am always drawn to the ingredients of this brand s shampoos and conditioners because they are sls free and have a variety of oils and extracts but every time i am disappointed this made my hair look flat frizzy and created a ton of static at first i thought it was the cold dry weather which can cause static but the longer i used this shampoo and conditioner i became suspicious gt _ gt sure enough as soon as i quit using these and went back to aussie the static went away i will probably not purchase another ogx product again after several bad experiences 
2016-08|4.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo|i don t have curly hair but i bought this shampoo because it can also help to manage static dry and frizzy hair all hair issues i have the conditioner it s self has a thick consistency upon washing my hair with the shampoo it cleaned my scalp well without over drying but on the downside not sure if i would purchase again just because the smell is a bit overpowering my hair feels a bit knotty and these products are quite expensive so i use sparingly 
2016-08|4.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo|i am a sucker for anything coconut scented was longing to try this but had to wait for a sale it s just too expensive to pay regular price for a shampoo in my opinion and as cute as the bottle is i really don t care for any shampoo conditioner that doesn t position the cap at the bottom so you can get all of the product out having said that the shampoo itself is lovely it has a very creamy thick texture and despite being sulfate free it lathers well and smells terrific no matter what shampoo i use i always wash twice because i only wash my hair twice a week and follow with conditioner this is pretty comparable to many other shampoos i ve used not particularly exceptional on its own except for the scent yes i really am a coconut junkie i am on the fence about repurchasing this product solely based on the packaging because i hate not being able to get all of the product out the fact that the cap is rounded means i can t really store this upside down without it tipping over so inevitably there will be some unfortunate wasted product 
2016-08|2.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo|i really really really wanted to love this product i bought both the shampoo and conditioner and have used them for a couple months my hair has never been so dry and brittle in my life the conditioner is very light so if you like a thicker conditioner this is not for you the shampoo does lather very well pros the smell absolutely amazing cons completely dried out my hair the conditioner is very light and it doesn t detangle or moisturize at all 
2015-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo|i have super straight coarse thick hair that has been highlighted about four times this last round of highlighting has really changed my hair texture and made it incredibly dry and straw like criessss i wanted something cheap sulfate free and most importantly cruelty free that would leave my hair soft and moisturized this is it i couldn t believe a shampoo could make my hair soft but as soon as you start massaging it into your scalp you can feel how soft your strands start to feel i use this in tandem with the matching conditioner which is also amazing scent is a citrusy coconutty smell that eventually fades but i don t find it to be offensive or cloying i have to blow dry my hair now during the winter because it gets too cold going to bed with a head full of wet hair but this works really well with a blow dryer and my hair ends up drying really silky and smooth 
2015-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo|i got this and the matching conditioner last year when they came out and i love it i have naturally spiral curly hair 3b mixed with 3a amp 3c s and i love how this shampoo doesn t strip my hair the scent is tropical amp yummy the shampoo is pretty thick amp a lil hard to get out of the bottle but it lathers up well amp rinses out easily i highly rec this if you have naturally curly hair 
2015-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo|my new hg shampoo leaves my curls soft and silky will definitely repurchase 
2015-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo|if there were 3 things in my kitchen i could concoct a shampoo of they would probably be honey lemon and coconut oil these are the key ingredients of this shampoo and it leaves my protein sensitive medium textured dry hair clean and ready for a moisturizing conditioner i get great results with this shampoo it s not overly clarifying stripping but it doesn t leave my hair with residue or weighed down will definitely repurchase 
2016-08|4.0|Moroccan surf paste|overall this is a pretty cool and unique product my hair is thick and dry with natural waves i recently stopped straightening it and am experimenting with products to enhance the natural texture i bought this on a desperate humid day when my hair was a frizz ball i tried working it through my dry frizzy hair it didn t spread it just made my hair feel even more fried and sticky in the patches that the product stuck it looked very matted and dull i couldn t wait to wash it out and was going to toss this i tried it again one day on damp hair the products spread much more easily i noticed that my hair felt thicker even when wet not something i usually like i twisted pieces threw it in a clip and let it dry when i took my hair down it was in fact much thicker than normal but my waves were more crimped and had a cool look to them no frizz but not shiny either it was just really cool textured surfer inspired hair this did not give me great 2nd day hair the healthier parts of my hair that aren t bleached held a bit of the texture the drier parts of my hair were huge matted and the frizziest i ve ever seen it i looked like a mental patient spraying in some water and then twisting into a bun revived things this is also great for a messy bun it gives it that rougher texture a lot of silicone based products seem to cause acne for me the natural wax and moisturizing ingredients in this do not bother my skin if you are looking for glossy defined waves this might not be the product also this did not work at all for me in dry hair but it plays beautifully with water i m excited to experiment with it some more 
2016-08|4.0|Moroccan surf paste|first not a big fan of dipping fingers in goop used prior to blow out and was able to get root lift in my fine thick hair still in learning curve but like product 
2016-08|5.0|Moroccan surf paste|oh my gosh i love this stuff it smells amazing beachy and slightly coconutty and kind of like moroccanoil i have fine thin hair that also manages to frizz like crazy and this paste has become my go to finishing step before leaving the house i take a teeny amount of the paste and rub it between my palms and then run my palms over my hair bam no frizz my hair stays frizz free and soft for hours and i smell like a mermaid and even though the paste is matte and promises a matte finish my hair looks much shinier when i use it probably because it blocks out my ever present halo of frizz i want to buy a pallet of this paste and store it in my closet forever it smells like summer and makes my hair look fantastic hg for sure 
2015-08|5.0|Moroccan surf paste|it s awesome am all natural and my hair is really sift thus making it difficult to get my curls out naturally however on using this product voila works like magic used a peasize and my twist out was awesome in fact i got one to try it out at cvs now i ve ordered for 4 cups you don t want to run out of this treasure 
2014-08|5.0|Moroccan surf paste|this stuff is awesome possibly hg but as i ve only been using it a few weeks it s still too early to tell i have curly hair for those of you familiar with naturallycurly com i have 3b curls for the rest of you i have spiral curls similar to keri russell it sounds a lot better than the reality of living with it i m always on the lookout for products that will make and keep my hair frizz free but define my curls without making them crunchy or weighing them down it s a lot to ask for since my hair has a ton of body but my actual hair strands are really fine i love and follow the curly girl method but as i m gluten intolerant i cannot use the devachan products they re really awesome by the way if wheat gluten is not an issue for you that s where the ogx surf paste comes in i apply about 2 pea sized amounts one to each side of my head scrunch let my hair air dry and i m good to go i smoosh and emulsify it in my palms before smoothing it over my damp hair it is a bit sticky they do call it paste p but it seems to stick to my hair well enough that i don t need to wipe my hands afterward it gives my hair incredible soft hold and definition that lasts all day if i feel my curls could use reviving i lightly spritz water on my hair or wet my hands and scrunch i m happy to report that my curls even remain intact overnight while sleeping though there is a soft frizz halo i would highly recommend this amazing product it s easy on the wallet too definite repurchase 
2014-08|5.0|Moroccan surf paste|alright so garnier s surf paste i m sorry i mean surfer hair power putty turned on me and with a name like that i m glad to ditch it i decided i needed something with more tack and weight but still adding texture that didn t make my hair feel heavy and gross seems impossible but you ladies who are into your hair products have got to know what i mean by that i tried garnier s pixie play cream but holy crap what a fail i wrote a review if you re interested moving on so the new hunt for the perfect texturizer finishing paste was on i was almost going to buy this when i saw how cheap pixie play was and opted for that at first run and that got returned pronto i mean like next day turn around here s my receipt take this devil off my hands in exchange i got this love it smells great works fabulous how to describe it s like if kms hair play paste and old school garnier surf paste were hybridized or how about if fx surf head a former fave and garnier surf paste got together it s just tacky enough finishes my ends and separates layers really beautifully and adds perfect texture it smells so pleasant just kind of sweet yet clean and mild i had a slight learning curve you definitely don t need much at all like two small ish dabs to get some product on your fingers rub into all over your fingers to warm it up and then just work it through your ends as you like i always just wipe off any residue on my body towel from after a shower and my hands are tack free after is that weird hey it works anyway sorry if that was tmi but i really like this and i think you get a ton of product for your money especially considering you only need a little each time you use it hope this helps i m super picky with my hair products for the record i have hair that is just past my shoulders in length so it s not just for the ladies with the cute short bobs and pixies you too can have hair that is both flowy yet perfectly texturized enjoy 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan surf paste|i really like this product it gives me really nice goldilocks curls this is a very sticky pomade that smells nice and perfumey you have to use a very small amount of this product because if you use too much it can give your hair a sticky texture i use just enough to thinly coat my hands in it and lightly scrunch for this same reason i use it when my hair is slightly damp right before it s almost all dry when i use this it helps control my frizz and holds my curls pretty well until the next wash 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan surf paste|smells nice like coconut sun screen the smell seems to linger though so if you don t like it don t get it i m using this on my short almost pixie style hair to give it a texurized messy look and with such short hair its easy to use way too much usually i try to just dab a finger in the wax and then melt it in my palms and that is usually a good amount scrunching and brushing my hair back with my fingers gives the voluminous sticky up look i m going for while holding my bangs in place i won t need to buy another one of these for ages because its so huge but i think if i don t find one that surpasses this and is perhaps creamier i would repurchase 
2016-08|2.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|bought for my 12 year old daughter at her request seems to be ok on her very thick slightly dry hair inexpensive 6 or less at target update after a few weeks of use it is way too drying not good not gonna repurchase 
2016-08|4.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|i bought this conditioner as a travel pack while i was in hospital and needed to smell like something other than surgical scrub the hospital provides this which all but destroyed my fine tangle prone hair it seemed like a pretty solid investment i got the shampoo and conditioner in travel size and a tangle teezer which i had never used before and now incidentally i love i bought this pack and then came to mua to check other peoples reviews because i apparently like to do things out of the usual order i was concerned people didn t seem to like the results they got from using this conditioner and was tossing up whether to give it a go or just return it and try something else i persevered and used it fully expecting a disaster of epic proportions firstly this conditioner smells amazing straight from the bottle like tropical coconutty juicy goodness but i found the smell didn t linger after my hair was dry just smelled clean and fresh which is all i really need anything to take the smell of chlorhexidine antiseptic scrub away texture wise it is thick but a small amount goes a decent way for fine hair like mine i hardly ever use conditioner since almost every product i have ever tried no matter what it claims weighs my hair down and i m left looking like severus snape come lunchtime not so with this one i gave it a go from roots to tips usually a surefire way to looking like i dunked my head in a chip fryer to see whether it was really going to live up to the claim quot weightless quot and it did i have lovely soft smooth shiny silky hair a lot of positive s words that looks beautifully clean and isn t a tangled mess like it almost always is not sure whether the new tangle teezer is the reason for the non tangliness but when i wet combed it i hit zero snags or snarls which is unheard of for me usually if i wet brush or even dry brush i find great chunks of my hair come out all sad and forlorn and broken but i think the combination of the new brush and the conditioner is a real winner pros smells divine not overpoweringly scented just enough to make you feel you re somewhere tropical and not in your shower a little bit goes a long way so it should last us fine haired people ages weightless finally a product that actually lives up to the promise and doesn t leave me looking like i ve climbed out of a stick of butter makes brushing a dream cons it s like 20 a bottle for a full size here in nz so that s a little painful but i can see myself taking 6 months to get through it so it s not too bad i wish the coconut smell would last a bit longer after my hair dries but i d probably just wander around sniffing it like a huge weirdo in which case i m glad that it just smells clean and fresh 
2015-08|1.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|i bought this to use with the cherry blossom ginseng shampoo i wanted more volume with my hair because i was using another line with this brand don t do this it s a very bad idea my hair went from soft and silky to dry and shiny without volume not really what i was trying for blah this has no hydration behind it i feel it s very lacking i need to return it 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|i m so glad that i read all of the reviews for this this is great i ve been using salon products but ran out of my usual and needed something inexpensive one of the reviewers said that you need to use the entire 3 step system they were right if you just use the shampoo and conditioner it doesn t work as well you must use the coconut water treatment after it sprays in and seriously leaves your hair looking like you just left the salon 
2014-08|2.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|i bought this because i love coconut and will give anything that smells tropical coconutty a try i love the smell of this and i d probably say it has a slightly nicer scent than the organix coconut milk conditioner after using it my hair felt smooth and hydrated when i got out of the shower but as soon as it dried my hair was back to its frizzy self so it didn t really do much i had to use loads of serum to make my hair look half decent 
2014-08|3.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|i wanted to give organix another chance as the last few conditioners i have used from the brand were just okay packaging and scent are important to me this one smells very coconut ty and tropical it makes me feel like i was on holiday at hawaii the texture of the product feels grainy like there are small pieces of coconut in the product it doesn t feel smooth like most of the conditioners i used but that is okay the scent takes getting used to as for how well the product does i would say not much and even if it did made my hair smooth after rinsing it off it did not last long organix seems to make products with lovely packaging and wonderful scents but with meh results this will be my last time using conditioners from this brand 
2014-08|1.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|i hate this it didnt make my hair feel silky or soft and it didnt detangle my hair at all but it did put a weird rubbery coating on my hair which was gross ive used better 1 00 suave conditioners compared to this waste of money dont buy this there are soooooooooo many better options 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|i use this conditioner along with the matching shampoo and i love how soft but full it leaves my short medium fine hair a lot of conditioners can soften and moisturize but few give you body too 
2014-08|5.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|i have used this 3 times now so i can honestly review that it is a good conditioner my hair is fine as it is and doesn t have any frizz issues so it works great for me the scent is just exhilirating i love all things coconut so this was up my alley this smooths my hair nicely and i look forward to my shower knowing that this stuff awaits me 
2014-08|4.0|Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Conditioner|i give this product a 3 5 but had to round up for this review i love the light weight feel of this conditioner the conditioner itself isn t heavy and when it s in my hair and afterwards man it s so weightless however this is not for winter time or any kind cold and or dry weather or climate i tried this during the middle of winter and it did a great job of detangling my hair in the shower where it s steamy and afterwards in the steamy bathroom but when it got into the drier bedroom it was nappy and dry and not sleek and afterwards when it was totally dry it was kinda frizzy so yeah definitely for summer in humid climate otherwise incredible smell and texture i won t buy this again just because with shampoo and conditioner i m usually like quot onto the next one quot once i finish a bottle 
2016-08|3.0|Tsubaki Blossom Conditioner|bought this because of the amazing floral scent if anyone knows other products that smell similarly please let me know this conditioner is pretty thick and probably decently moisturizing but the shampoo was way too drying for this to be any good sometimes i use it with a more gentle shampoo just because i love the way it smells but i definitely would not buy this again 
2016-08|4.0|Tsubaki Blossom Conditioner|this smells so darn good if it were in perfume form i would wear it for sure made my hair soft and smooth good for quot normal quot hair i would say as in not super dry damaged or curly hair i also like to use this on days when i don t want to shampoo but still want fresh smelling non frizzy hair
2015-08|4.0|Tsubaki Blossom Conditioner|i have straight asian hair with medium thickness and some damage on my ends from bleaching the tsubaki blossom line works great for me and makes me hair suuuuper smooth detangled and soft the shampoo scent is subtle i could barely smell anything however the conditioner has a stronger scent it s still not as strong as a lot of shampoos conditioners out there though i wouldn t say it s a bad thing if you are sensitive to scents i noticed reviews from curly haired women and they said that it barely moisturizes their hair so i don t think this is the line for you if you have curly wavy and or thick hair but it is great for people with straight hair because it makes me hair smooth shiny soft and bouncy afterwards be careful not to put too much conditioner if you have thin hair it may weigh it down 
2015-08|3.0|Tsubaki Blossom Conditioner|yes this is pretty average and doesn t give my hair the moisture it craves it does have a great scent and it leaves some decent shine and frizz control this line is a hit or miss for me typically and i have tried most of the popular scents there are better options however the macadamia line is quite good in my opinion if you do want to try something from organix 
2014-08|3.0|Tsubaki Blossom Conditioner|this conditioner was average i have really thick and dry hair so this did not give it moisture or make it soft the matching shampoo is horrible i might give this a second chance and post and update ingredients water aqua cetearyl alcohol behentrimonium chloride cetyl alcohol glycerin ceteareth 20 camellia sinensis tsubaki flower extract bambusa vulgaris bamboo extract dimethicone cyclopentasiloxane dimethiconol glycol distearate glycol stearate isopropyl alcohol propylene glycol dmdm hydantoin diazolidinyl urea iodopropynyl butylcarbamate methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone magnesium chloride magnesium nitrate fragrance parfum ext violet 2 ci 60730 red 33 ci 17200 
2016-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask|it makes my hair feel so soft and smells amazing i ve always loved organix products 
2015-08|3.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask|i m tossed up with this one i ve only been using it for about a month and i love the feel and look it gives my hair after using it but after the next couple of days my hair doesn t seem that great the smell is just amazing i will say my hair is a bit softer but nothing dramatic i ll keep trying it out though 
2014-08|3.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask|i really wanted to do a deep conditioning treatment which is something i hadn t done in a long time this product contains silicones which my hair negatively reacts to i have curly hair i used this product in 2 different ways in the first method i shampooed my hair slept with the mask on and rinsed it out the next day but it left it really frizzy and harder to detangle and style my hair felt like straw but i actually liked the results when it dried though from day 5 7 my hair tangled amp frizzed up so much in the second method i left it in for 20 minutes and washed it out with a shampoo and styled it this method worked perfectly my hair was soft and smooth in the end with little frizz but honestly i would not repurchase this product i ve tried other hair masks which left my head full of plump moisturised curls however everyone s hair is different so i would recommend that you at least try it if you re looking for a deep conditioner if you want an in depth review of this hair mask you can check out my blogpost http teayii blogspot com 2013 03 review organix awapuhi ginger instant html 
2013-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask|i am not into buying hair products for fun especially if it has esoteric ingredients names written in big letter across the packaging i bought this one because my hair seemed very dry this winter and it was also on special for 4 dollars i let it sit for about 5 minutes and followed with morocanoil as usual my hair is so soft there is no more dry strand flying around it s the second time i use it in two weeks and i will definitely buy more of it if it s on sale if you have color treated fine to medium hair i recommended it 
2013-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask|fabulous hair mask i love the whole entire awapuhi ginger line by organix i have tried the organix macadamia oil mask before and hated it once my hair was dry it felt dry brittle and tangled up the awapuhi ginger mask is 100 x s better it actually feels like a mask it left my hair soft and silky absolutely recommend 
2012-08|3.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask|picked this up on a whim at the drugstore haven t used any hair masks before but i expected more this isn t more effective than a conditioner if you put it on for about 3 minutes i tried putting it on for 20 min like it says on the container today and my hair does feel lovely and soft and manageable but it s still underwhelming for the price smells fantastic though but after i finish my tub i won t be buying again
2012-08|2.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask| __reviewtextreadmorev2__ data enableyoutubepreview true data productid 156918 data reviewid 2413914 data text not a fan i am usually not a fan of this line at all and this product was no exception i was sucked into the instant recovery tagline and cute tub it comes in but it left my hair dry and i left it on for more than the 20 mins with a brand new plastic shower cap i get good results leaving my regular masque on for this long it was nowhere near the way i expected it to be and was nowhere near as good as my regular i went out to repurchase my fave and thinking of giving this one away to a friend maybe it will work for someone else but not for me unfortunately not a fan i am usually not a fan of this line at all and this product was no exception i was sucked into the instant recovery tagline and cute tub it comes in but it left my hair dry and i div
2012-08|2.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask|i m not usually a fan of organix products and this conditioning mask is no different first let me say that i do like the organix moroccan oil line this product however did not leave my hair in any better condition than say white rain conditioner seriously this is supposed to be a moisturizing mask my hair felt super dry and tangled after leaving this mask on for 10 minutes my hair doesn t feel or look repaired whatsoever i used up the whole product just because of principal but i will not repurchase two products from organix that are absolute gold are the moroccan oil condiyioner and the styling oil all of their other products are drying and damaging in my opinion 
2012-08|5.0|Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask|organix is one of my favorite drugstore lines i especially like the yummy smelling awapuhi ginger products which includes this super hydrating treatment mask after shampooing i work this mask through wet hair and leave it on for 3 5 minutes while i finish my shower it rinses easily and leaves my hair feeling nourished not weighed down for extremely dry and or damaged hair you can up the conditioning factor by covering your hair with a shower cap and keeping the treatment on for 20 minutes 
2016-08|5.0|Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter |at first i thought this was too heavy but once i learned how to apply it for my hair i fell in love i already really like the entire ogx argan oil line and i use the shampoo conditioner on a rotating basis with some of their other lines i also use the argan oil intense hydrating treatment once a week to deep condition so if you enjoy that this is one step up condition wise i don t usually like tub containers but this is easy enough to open and there is plenty in there to last a while i typically shampoo and condition leaving my hair clipped up to rinse after i do everything else once i wash my conditioner out i grab two fingertips worth of this work it through my hands and then run it through the bottom 3 4 s of my hair i leave this in and pat my hair dry with a towel add hair oil brush through add curl cream and style obviously it isn t an hg that lets me skip other conditioners but my 2 ft long curly hair can use all the help it can get in winter the great smell consistent shine and reasonable price and sales make this a great product in my hair arsenal pros reasonable price especially on sale great smell leaves hair shiny and soft works well with curls and waves good detangler multi use huge amount of product for the price cons works differently depending how you use it so there is a learning curve this product in particular is harder to find in stores than others in the argan oil line 
2016-08|4.0|Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter |awesome 
2016-08|5.0|Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter |this product does not really do much for my hair but i found a great use for it i keep the tub in my shower and after i turn off the water and lightly towel off so still damp i use this as an in shower moisturizer it is fantastic a small amount covers a large area it soaks in but leaves my skin super smooth it does not have a strong scent which i prefer so it does not clash with my fragrance once i am done i lightly towel off and that is it i do not need to use any extra moisturizers and my skin feels hydrated even at the end of the day i find that i am not needing to apply moisturizer before bed it is very economical about 12 50 for a tub that will last a long time and can be found everywhere here in the us cvs walmart markets etc i would recommend it as an in shower moisturizer 
2016-08|3.0|Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter |too much for my hair can only use about once a month or have to clarify out leaves hair too soft to hold any shape or style however as a body moisturizer new favorite last bit in shower rub in dry parts quick rinse and i have very soft moisturized skin 
2016-08|4.0|Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter |this is good stuff for the price i love the packaging too because you can use as little or as much as you need when i m having really dry days i leave a tiny bit in about a dime size for my medium length thin fine hair when i m having normal days i wash it out i have thin hair so most days i wash it out for a drugstore brand this is great stuff and smells lovely medium depth floral make sure not to leave the lid off for any length of time or the product will start drying and yellowing 
2016-08|5.0|Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter |this hair butter is not available in asia countries i bought mine via online and shipped from wilmington usa this is my third favourite ogx organix products first is coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and second is repairing awapuhi ginger dry styling oil this hair butter has a unique name creamy hair butter in 187g in a tub which is fully filled which it delivers its promise by hydrating dry hair and works wonderfully well before and after i flat iron my hair it smells similar to ogx penetrating argan oil serum and nothing irritating or overpowering and it is a plus that its texture is really buttery and smooth to spread exactly in a heavy butter cream based and nothing waxy like a hair wax or egyptian magic cream let me mention abit of the background cum history of my hair i am an asian who used to dye my hair alot and i had chemically straightened my hair which caused it burnt due to leaving in more than its recommended time and my hair ended up dry brittle and crinkled ever since that incident my hair never returns to its original healthy condition i do not have the black smooth and sleek hair which everyone jealous about for being an asian i have to flat iron my hair almost everyday to keep them tamed and eliminate the annoying frizz using hair oil when my hair is towel dried is a must and thereafter to apply another layer of cream or serum for heat resistant before i start using flat iron you can most probably imagine how dry and how bad my hair is my hair will only be presentable and i can have a good hair day after these multiple application well a single serum oil sometimes will not work incredibly well enough to calm my frizz and keep it moistures for at least one day a little remind that this hair butter contains mineral oil which i think some people would like to avoid using it i used to avoid using and buying any serums oils that contain mineral oil after reading all the negative comments and there are many salon exclusive and famous brands that contain good oils and vega ingredients sesame walnut oil famous in japan brand hair oil olive sunflower argan camelia soybean macadamia grapeseed coconut oil with acid amino to repair and hydrate hair ends to prevent split end on top of the ingredient lists i am somehow very attracted by this hair butter and willing to give it a try that it can do a good job and not like those water gel based cream gelee which only suit fine hair and the effect only lasts for a few hours and the frizz returns i miss garnier sleek and shine cream which makes me astonished after seeing its effect on my hair but this product is hard to get and seems like only available in ebay or other online shopping which does not ship to my country but with this new lovely hair butter it without any hesitation can replace my old love i will only use this hair butter for leave in purpose and it will last for months and worth every single cents that i have paid no regret in buying and if you have dry coarse hair you might want to give it a try but do not over using it for your first few attempts as it makes your hair oily and you might end up rewash your hair i have tried and tested this hair butter by going to a hot and humid place with fans blowing everywhere and no finger combing or combing my hair to keep in tidy and after 2 hours i return home and my hair surprisingly is kempt and not crazily frizzing like a mad chick which it used to be will buy this product again even if i need to wait for weeks for its arrival do give it a try if you are a product maniac like me and have tried out most of the high end products but you still cannot find the so called quot you re the one quot 
2015-08|2.0|Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter |the super positive reviews on this product outside of mua made me buy it unfortunately i am the first person reviewing this product in makeupalley which in my opinion has the most reliable reviews anyway this product does not live up to its promises when using it as a deep treatment in the shower your hair can get super heavy and dull and when using a very small amount it does not bring desirable results either very poor performance definitely not usable as a deep treatment no matter how much or how little you use using it as a leave in is much better from my experience but still the results are very mediocre the ends are crunchy yet greasy and beware if you use it on almost dry hair be ready for a greasy mess you know what the main problem with this product is the terrible thick film it leaves on your hair wanna know the name beeswax i should ve known why would they put beeswax in this i mean the scent is nice the conditioner is very thick as a butter duh d but i honestly see no use for this my hair is not even damaged it just tends to get dry this is supposed to be pure moisture and contains no protein whatsoever if it was very mediocre with my hair i honestly can t tell what it would do with your hair if you love heat or dyes all in all i find organix products to be very mediocre and it s a shame that you can get much better hair with herbal essences or dove what s the organic thing in these products if they have effing beeswax heck even herbal essences silicones are water soluble sad because the packaging of this is beautiful don t fall for the marketing ladies not going to spend a penny in organix products anymore completely disappointed

2016-08|4.0|Bamboo Fiber-Full Thickening Fiber Cream|i found this on clearance at walgreens and now that i did i hope it s not being discontinued first off i like the scent it s a bit floral and while i m not wild about a lot of fragrances i find this pleasant the texture is like a cream and adding it to my hair it feels like adding a bit of conditioner rather than some volume boosting product my hair is on the fine side dry with some wave frizz curl and a bit of this doesn t weigh it down which is a relief i ve so far only tried it on dry hair for a bit of definition and boost and it does add a bit of shine tame some frizz and make my hair look a bit fuller all without making my hair feel like it has a bunch of sticky or crunchy product on it it s not a miracle in a bottle but i can actually see myself using this up which is in itself a minor miracle

2016-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|what a waste of money honestly this did nothing for my hair i gave it to my mother to use as a heat protecting when she straightens her hair 
2016-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i used this spray to try and combat my dry frizzy ends and this did nothing for my hair it smelled very sweet and this treatment made my hair feel sticky there are far better sprays out there much better than this one wouldn t purchase this again 
2014-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i tried two a leave in cream and a spray the cream was heavy weighed my hair down and made it tangled the spray i do like it makes my hair smell good nothing too strong or overwhelming my hair is left soft but doesn t seem to do much as far as making my hair healthier it does look better on the days i use a straightener 
2014-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|this made my hair gorgeous for about 5 minutes after gave my thick curly hair that highly desirable frizzy caught in the rain look and made it crunchy yep it does smell great but even the scent fades fairly quickly 
2014-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i picked up a few bottles of these at walgreens on clearance i like the smell of this it s right on and really does smell like coconuts i like using this product on my hair as soon as i get out of the shower and when i m using heat products i think this product is a bit over priced i like it but i m not sure i d repurchase unless it were on sale 
2014-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i love this product i love the smell the way my hair looks after i have used it my split ends are looking 10x better and it makes me look like im in one of those shampoo ads only down side is the price and sometimes it makes you hair look greasy 
2014-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i ve been using this for several weeks now and there has been a noticeable improvement to my hair my hair went through a phase of being very dry and frizzy recently as i started using this product people have been commenting on how silky and healthy it s looking and my boyfriend loves the smell i ve been using this together with the moroccan oil which would also be a factor for the improvement in my hair but overall quite happy with this product 
2014-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i wanted to love this because i love the shampoo and conditioner and i love the smell but i don t i kinda hate it i ran out of my garnier fructis curl sculpting cream stuff and bought this thinking it would be great you have to use a ton it doesn t spread evenly because it s crazy thick and if you don t get it just right in your hair it leaves it stiff and chunky feeling so thick but doesn t spread and you have to use a ton just are a horrible combo not to mention it doesn t do much for sculpting your waves i just don t like it i m going to stick with garnier fructis stuff in the tube that stuff is amazing 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i cannot begin to explain how much i love this product it s probably the most amazing leave in conditioner that i have ever used not only because it smells amazing but also the long term effects on my hair having dry regularly dyed hair split ends and frizz is inevitable what i love most about this product is how it not only reverses this issue but i can also use as much as i want need the bottle says to only use a few sprays but i go ahead and use 6 on towel dried damp hair it doesn t weigh your hair down i don t wash my hair everyday so if needed i ll just spray some here there on dry hair and i m good to go pros super amazing scent weightless doesn t weigh hair down or turn you into a grease slick use on either damp or dry hair smooths frizz tames ends leaves hair soft and manageable great for adding moisture in between washes 1 bottle lasts for ages approx 2 months if using it religiously cons packaging sometimes leaks if on its side so not fun to travel with 17 in australia i m a tight a 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|without this product my hair is horrible it s my holy grail leave in conditioner it makes my hair smooth shiny and tame 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i purchased this nourishing milk on a whim last week while searching for an inexpensive alternative to it s a 10 miracle leave in product which has been my go to for years now out of the overwhelming number of options in the store s haircare section i chose to purchase this product because of the pleasant scent and inexpensive price tag of 6 i am so glad that i decided to purchase this it makes my naturally straight fine hair super shiny and silky to the touch if not even more than it s a 10 it does not make my hair greasy either the fact that i ve had such great results when using this during the colder weather season when my hair is typically the driest during the year impresses me even more and assures me that this nourishing milk really was a great find 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i think this is the 2nd best thing i ve ever purchased for my hair after the dove nutritive therapy nourishing care serum i use this just after my shower before i brush my hair and it is amazing my hair is almost completely detangled and so conditioned not to mention the absolute amazing smell i usually can wait a few days to wash my hair so if i wash it monday night u can usually wait until wednesday night or thursday depending on what im doing during this time i use the conditioning milk every morning and night only on my ends and i ve never had my ends look so good with prolonged colouring around 7 years worth i almost forgot this stuff lasts for ages smell wise and length of product my hair never smells of anything other than coconut amp i only repurchase around every 2 3 months using 3 4 sprays every use 6 8 per day best product in a very long time would recommend to everyone 
2013-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i take showers at night so when i wake up sometimes my hair is a little bit frizzy or dry i spray this product all throughout my hair and it softens it so much i also use it before i straighten or blow dry and let it settle in for a little while before spraying on the heat protectant it just seems to make my hair so much softer than when i don t use it before i straighten i will definitely be buying this product again 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i bought this product on a whim i got a 10 cash back coupon at cvs and i decided to use it right then and there before it expired on me which is what usually happens it was displayed close to the check out counter and i grabbed it along with a couple of chap sticks to equal out to the ten bucks i tend to love anything quot coco nutty quot so i knew i would probably love the smell at least what i didn t expect was how great my hair felt after using this it was soft and shiny and very tame normally this time of year with the humidity my hair can be a frizzy yucky mess the milk really tamed the wild beast and i would recommend it to friends and i plan on making it a regular in my daily beauty routine 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i love this leave in conditioner i m not a fan of the shampoo conditioner from brand but totally in love with the leave in conditioner i normally spray onto my hair after i get out of the shower and towel dry leaves my hair so soft and smooth plus i love the coconut smell the price is ridiculous here in australia almost 18 for this bottle so i ll definatly buy when there s a sale 
2013-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|organix is way over priced down in australia it goes for about 17 plus which wouldn t be too bad if the products weren t so mediocre i ve been looking for a trully moisturisng smoothing product to give my dry hair some life and based on somewhat positive reviews i thought this would be it was not left my hair feeling drier than ever and did nothing to contribute to softness shine snd moisture big regret seeing that i spent so much money on it 17 is outrageous for a drug store product 
2013-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|never ever ever buy this my hair is so curly and this that when i tried it it made my hair very tangled up clogged bushy split ends and did damadge to my hair took me about 4 months to get it better but it made me spend hundreds of on hair products like shampoos conditioners leave in s etc btw it stopped my hair from growing because it was so damadged so yeah 
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i love this leave in conditioner first i have an oily scalp with long thick dry unruly hair it s kind of just a wavy puff ball but this spray it does wonders not only does it smell divine but it really makes my hair soft shiny and really defines my waves i spray about 3 4 pumps into my hands and run through from ends up and then repeat another 2 3 times i will definitely repurchase 
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i love this stuff it works so well and thats all i can really say i use a small amount that i mainly use on the ends of my hair and its so soft now i recieve compliments from friends and family all of the time who also say it smells great i would strongly reccommend this product 
2012-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|all i have to say is that this product is pure crap it doesn t do anything for my hair waste of money 
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i love this leave in i think it s the most amazing thing that ever happened to my hair i waited for a couple a uses before i reviewed because sometimes it takes a while for products to truly shine haha get it but really there was no need even on the first time that i spritzed it on after i let it air dry it was the silkiest shiniest state that my hair had ever been in and get this my hair is also likely one of the most damaged you ll ever come across feels like straw in some places everybody buy it it s amazing lt 3
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|amazing i created my makeupalley account to write this review which is saying something to give you an idea my hair is longlonglong and naturally frizzy and wavy and i usually either straighten it or french braid it overnight to define the waves i spray this in my hair as soon as it s towel dried and it instantly works to detangle and soften my hair i ve noticed my hair is much more tame when it air dries after i ve used this i also use it lightly before and after styling and to refresh my hair throughout the day never have i found such a versatile effective wonderful hair product d
2011-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i have a bleached section of my hair which i dye a lot and this keeps it from getting dry and crunchy and damaged it feels just so refreshing i like this stuff
2011-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|upon first purchasing this product i liked the packaging and what it was supposed to do for my hair after a few months of use i wasn t as pleased with the results it made my hair feel dirty faster like a film over my hair but only noticed this after trying out another product that was supposed to provide the same results and didn t weigh down my hair 
2010-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|this product really benefited my dry damaged hair it made my hair shiny amp removed a lot of frizz also you should try te organix shea butter liquid glass serum because it works amazing with this product trust me my hair i d extremely damaged amp without these products my hair would be disgusting p
2010-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|usually i would wait longer before writing a review but i have used this twice and i am in love with it i ve never been so excited about a line but the coconut milk smells absolutely gorgeous i already am using the instant repair treatment which i don t like as much doesn t feel like it s doing much for my hair and the smell doesn t last and i am about to buy the split ends mender pros really nice sweet coconut smell that lingers even overnight also covers up the smell from other hair products like hairspray easy to apply and evenly distribute through hair comes in a spray bottle good consistency like water doesn t feel like you have anything in your hair at all leaves my hair really soft and shiny cons really poor packaging if i tip the bottle to the side even slightly liquid just pours out i have no idea how i got it home in my bag in the first place might just be a fault with my bottle i m not sure price 4 18 aud packaging 1 repurchase yes 
2010-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i have bought this stuff a second time which i almost never do especially with hair products but when i do it means i really do like it i gave this a 3 out of 5 because i really do like it but i don t know if it does a lot for my hair it s like a very subtle hair perfume it makes it smell great and lasts all day with very subtle effects on my hair but i still like it a lot i think the highest selling point of this stuff is the smell it smells a pina colada but not in a tacky way it smells like real coconut besides that on my thick blonde hair it leaves it soft and silky it also de frizzes and de poofs my hair but not a lot i usually use this right out of the shower i towel dry it comb it and then spray this all over and brush comb through and put healthysexyhair soy renewal argan oil and paul mitchell super skinny smoothing serum and let my hair air dry without using the leave in nourishing milk my hair gets poofier that usual and frizz that doesn t go away with more hair products pros smell defrizzes depoofs lightweight makes hair silky did i mention that it smells really good cons almost 6 00 really watery doesn t feel like it soaks in 
2009-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|this leave in smells delicious it s not heavy which i like sometimes i just use straight coconut oil but thats a little heavy i wouldn t say that it s changed my hair much but then again no leave in ever has i bleached my hair for over year so it s pretty much irreparable at the moment 
2009-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i have never been more excited about a great hair find in my life this nourishing coconut milk is a dream i love the consistency it is not too heavy and not too oily it s perfect i love running this through my hair when its damp and it stays perfectly hydrated throughout the day if your hair is dry this stuff is a godsend what i love most about it is that it doesn t make my hair poofy i had been using a creme from the john frieda brilliant brunette line however that only agreed with me when the weather was a certain way if it was too cold out my hair felt drier i don t have that problem with this my hair stays soft to the touch regardless of climate i appreciate that this is organic and that it contains the two things my hair needed coconut oil and egg protein i can t get enough of it the price is beyond reasonable a bottle runs roughly 7 and change the scent is really pretty as well most of all my hair looks and feels like it is in fact being nourished 
2009-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk|i bought this because it was free after a mail in rebate it s light and non greasy and i love the coconut smell but i don t think it does much to my hair other than give it that nice scent my hair doesn t look any shinier or more nourished than it did before i began to use this perhaps it is affecting my hair on a microscopic level as for what i can see i ve used other leave in conditioner type products that have left my hair looking more nourished i basically like this product so i ll continue to use it until it runs out but i don t like it enough to buy it again it costs about 7 or 8 dollars which isn t pricey but it s still more than i want to pay just to get my hair to smell nice i should also note that the bottle doesn t seem to be very leak proof unless there was some sort of shipping incident evey bottle of this stuff at target had leaked and the print on the lables was running the other organix products were fine it was just the nourishing milk that was wet and icky 
2016-08|2.0|Kukui Oil Shampoo|heavy on the oil agree with other poster this gets in my winter rotation if i think my hair is very dry but won t use daily 
2015-08|3.0|Kukui Oil Shampoo|this shampoo did nothing for me true it didn t strip my color but that s the only positive thing i can say about it it didn t hydrate my hair at all or have any noticeable benefit whatsoever i m simply not impressed with it at all i have discovered a sulfate free brand that i much prefer shea moisture i love the manuka honey and the tahitian noni formulas as well as the raw shea butter formula the honey formula is very hydrating so it s best for dry damaged hair the raw shea formula is also moisturizing but perhaps a bit less so than the honey one the tahitian noni formula is hydrating as well and works well on frizz the sm conditioners are wonderful as well as are the masks i use the honey or shea mask for 45 minutes or so with a heat cap every two weeks or so they work really well and the effects last through several shampoos i can definitely tell a difference when i use sm products whereas i never noticed anything positive about organix products so if you want a sulfate free poo that really does what it claims then try sm it s a bit more expensive than organix but well worth it i ended up pitching my organix shampoos my hair needs tlc and they did nothing for me i definitely don t recommend this shampoo try sm instead 
2015-08|1.0|Kukui Oil Shampoo|this shampoo and conditioner were terrible for my coarse frizzy hair my hair felt stripped of any moisture and was tangled and even worse to deal with than usual it was dull and like straw i was so dissapointed as i have liked other products from this brand not sure what happened here but they missed the mark i washed my hair tonight with a new brand of shampoo and conditioner and actually felt relieved that this kukui oil stuff was out of my strands 
2015-08|1.0|Kukui Oil Shampoo|i used this for about 2 weeks this shampoo conditioner combination is one of the worst i ve tried it turned my otherwise reasonably healthy hair into straw kukui oil on its own is so wonderful but this formulation is awful my hair s overall condition improved once i stopped using the combination 
2014-08|3.0|Kukui Oil Shampoo|i have to say i was was a little disappointed with this shampoo and its matching conditioner the shampoo is light yellow color with a creamy texture and it leathers really well it felt really hydrating and soft in my hair and so did the matching conditioner the conditioner also had pretty good slip so i was surprised that these two products made my hair feel a bit hard and tangled after rinsing although these products helped with my frizz and didn t dry out my hair they definitely didn t give my hair the softness and manageability that i was hoping for i won t be repurchasing these again update 6 19 2017 i ve tried organix shampoos and conditioners in the past and was not impressed i found the shampoos of this line to be very drying and the conditioners did not have much slip so i was kind of reluctant to give this brand another try i tried the kukui oil shampoo and conditioner in the past and wasn t very impressed but after a few years i was intrigued by the launch of new organix products so i decided to give the kukui oil line another try and i m glad i did for one thing the kukui oil line must have been reformulated because the scent color and texture are completely different than i remember the shampoo is very thick and creamy and to my surprise was a very moisturizing the shampoo is sulfate free and lathers very nicely and thoroughly cleanses my hair without stripping it the conditioner is also great it is very thick and has amazing slip the shampoo and conditioner have a pleasant light coconut scent my hair was left very soft and shiny with added volume organix has definitely improved tremendously 
2014-08|1.0|Kukui Oil Shampoo|my hair got way too greasy using this will not buy again 
2014-08|3.0|Kukui Oil Shampoo|i bought this since it was on sale at cvs i paired it with the sea minerals conditioner and had a good hair day there are cones in this shampoo so remember to clarify it has an ok scent but it fades it does clean pretty well and doesn t leave any residue on my scalp or hair it doesn t leave my hair feeling very moisturized but it does provide shine it also leaves my hair less puffy after air drying if your hair is not too damaged and dry this shampoo should be proficient just follow with a moisturizing conditioner 
2014-08|3.0|Kukui Oil Shampoo|i have thick coarse dry hair and this gave my hair shine but not much help with the frizz i doubt i will buy again i also think the scent remminds me with men s shampoo with masculine like fragrance to it i live in humid east texas coast and ogx s kukui bottle mentions this being good for frizz caused by humidity but not in this case i don t think anything can take on east texas humidity i would not recomment this product to anyone 
2016-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|buy don t hesitate great stuff 
2015-08|4.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|love love love the smell of this conditioner it shocked me because it did an amazing job at conditioning and adding moisture to my somewhat dry hair but it also brought out the natural waves in my hair keep in mind its a conditioner i didn t even bother picking up the shampoo because i am a conditioner junkie this has got to be my favorite out of all my conditioners right now the smell lingers forever only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is because the texture is a little funny its sort of slippery instead of creamy im assuming because it is more natural but ill take it because it makes my hair look amazing try it out ladies for sure especially if you have naturally wavy hair like i do 
2015-08|3.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|so i posted a review on this shampoo and conditioner previously but since then i have noticed that my hair sheds sooooo bad after i use them and i know it s this product because my hair never sheds so bad like it does with this stuff i m talking like handfuls of hair scary right yeah i m going to give these away cuz i don t wanna waste them i m disappointed cuz these make my hair soft and it smells great but i can t deal with losing that much hair ðÿ ž

2014-08|4.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i just started using this shampoo but it has already made my hair soft and i hope it starts improving the quality of my hair over time and does everything it says it does i m confident with all of the positive reviews i m reading very excited to see hoe it works out 
2014-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i m pretty shocked at how great this and the matching conditioner work on my hair i have long fine textured but thick color treated nothing extensive i use olia to match my natural dark brown hair color to cover the gray coming in 1c hair i m temporarily a bit broke so i couldn t afford my usual beloved bumble and bumble this go round and i d heard good things about this line so i thought i d give it a go my hair is soft shiny and bouncy and i haven t noticed it fading my color i don t think i ll be going back to bumble and bumble except for their styling products i didn t think i d ever say that 
2013-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|listen up y all i ve got thick curly long hair the thing is with thick curly long hair is that it is a bitch to take care of for years i switched shampoo and conditioner constantly because my hair was still a frizzy mess after every bottle and then i saw this little beauty well not this one specifically but the same brand sitting on the bottom shelf out shined by the pantene and the garnier and the l oreal kids from day 1 my hair was softer we re not talking perfect but better and the longer i kept with it the more the curls became defined and soft and bouncy i ve been using this brand faithfully for 4 years i don t even have to cut my hair anymore because i don t get split ends at all we re talkin zero and if you have curly hair you know what a big deal that is with this all i have to do is shower and comb my hair and the hair just dries into a nice cascade of curls but this is after 4 years you can t expect overnight instant glam people no shampoo will give you that but this will repair your damaged hair as much as possible and keep the new growth healthy the smell is an absolutely wonderful floral that is faint on the hair but if you have your hair up and then take it down you will release wafts of floral like you had just come from rolling in a pile of flowers and people will flock to you to smell your hair i m not kidding you re gonna make some friends just because your hair smells nice you re gonna get more creaminess than lather but really people lather isn t always a good thing lather comes from sulfates sulfates aren t great for your hair capisce speaking of sulfates when i first started using this they were completely sulfate free now i see they ve added a sulfate in the ingredients which disappoints me but i m guessing they got sick of people complaining about not having lather i have not however seen any difference in how this shampoo cares for my hair if anything it s better if having a quot no sulfate quot shampoo is really really important to you i understand but this is as close as you re gonna get for a drugstore product i have one problem with the bottle and that s that you cant see how much is left there s no way to remove the cap so you re just forced to guesstimate based on how loud the bottle s shart noises are as you work your way to the bottom but it s a great size easy to hold with one hand in short go out buy yourself a couple bottles take care of your hair it ll do the rest 
2013-08|3.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|pravana s sulfate free shampoo is my hg at the moment but i simply cannot afford it at something like 15 a bottle my hair is dry thin curly frizzy color treated demi permanents once in a while and prone to fallout from medication i liked this at first but my hair is now dry and breaking because of this shampoo have been in denial and used about 70 of the bottle i want to use an actual sulfate free shampoo but i fear i just can t find one in my price range looking for a new shampoo 
2013-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i have naturally wavy hair that is extremely dry coarse i m also prone to split ends due to heat styling i bought this because i was looking for something to help repair prevent some of the damage that my flat iron inflicts without stripping my keratin treatment i ve got a few shampoos left out of the bottle and my hair feels like silk after every use i ve been using for about two months since i only wash my hair 2 3 times a week when used in combination with the conditioner all i have to do is apply some anti frizz cream and let my hair air dry for a beach wave look also it smells amazing the only complaint i really have is the bottle design i wish the top was flat so that i could store it upside down allowing all of the product to flow to the top of the container 
2013-08|1.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|my friends raved about how this shampoo made their hair smell amazing so when i ran out of mine i bought some well thats great that it makes your hair smell good but it took me two times of shampooing to get a good lather going on my whole head that greatly irritates me because the bottle is small and cost me 7 at my grocery store which means i will have to use twice as much and buy it twice as fast and spend more money than i usually would that is a rip off i didn t notice anything different about my hair except that it didn t repair anything in fact it made it look and feel like my split ends were a bit worse i guess shelling out all the extra money for its a 10 products is worth it in the long run 
2013-08|3.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|this shampoo would be my hg shampoo if it weren t for one thing i would really just use this shampoo forever and ever and forget about all other shampoos it leaves my hair silky and incredibly shiny no other shampoo makes my hair so shiny it also defines my waves better than any other shampoo and smells amazing however i can not use it because it gives me horrible dandruff i can t even get away with using it once i can feel it irritating my scalp no other shampoo has this effect on me i don t know what it is i don t see anyone else having this problem with this shampoo so it may work for someone else i still honestly think its worth a try for the record i have fine dry damaged color treated hair this shampoo fades color all in all i personally would not buy again but it definitely could be an amazing shampoo for someone else 
2013-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|so far i am absolutely in love with this shampoo i bought it because it is repairing and it smells amazing i have dry damaged hair from bleaching and color treating but i also have a really oily scalp so my hair needs something that can not be too drying but not be too moisturizing i am very particular when it comes to shampoos and conditioners i do not like to mess around with my hair in the condition that it is in and i do not tolerate sulfates in my shampoo at all they are the devil for damaged hair and this shampoo does not contain any luckily i was really worried when i first squeezed this out of the bottle because it is incredibly thick i always shampoo twice and after the first shampoo the lather was kind of poor which happens with every shampoo but upon the second round the lather was very rich and creamy and felt very hydrating and healthy when i get out of the shower and let my hair air dry it feels soft and looks very healthy my boyfriend actually commented once on how great it looked after using this shampoo i like that with this shampoo i can wait the full 2 3 days before washing and my scalp doesn t feel oily and i don t feel like i m in dire need of dry shampoo i don t own the conditioner presently but i would love to try it out after i am out of my current one i hope for good results with this will update after a few months of use but so far would recommend i usually alternate between 2 brands of shampoo and conditioner so my hair doesn t get used to the products i use so i will be using a different brand in between now and my next purchase 
2013-08|3.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|when i first started using this product i was in love with it i love the smell and the way my hair felt after a few months of using it i started to feel my hair slowly get damage my ends were starting to break off and just feel like gum if that makes sense i have chemically treated hair and its on the dry side so using this product was not helping but instead damaging my poor hair i wash my hair every other day to every other 2 days so it s not like i was using it too often i gave it 3 lips because the smell is great and the product does last a good amount of time i will probably not finish whats left and just move on to a better shampoo 
2013-08|4.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i love this shampoo it leaves my hair so soft and shiny i did recently do a hot oil treatment at home and usually i can wash all the oil out with two washes three tops but after washing my hair with this shampoo like 6 times i just reached for some suave i think it s great for my dry hair that it strips the hair less than other brands i ve used but i m not sure it would be so great for oily hair i love the light scent of this shampoo i just wish it came in a bigger bottle it doesn t last that long but overall i m very happy with it and will continue to repurchase it s not the best but one of the best i ve used and the price is pretty good and i like that it s available in my small town 
2013-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i love this soooooo much i have tried the organix macadamia oil coconut milk keratin oil biotin and collagen and moroccan oil lines and hated them for some reason my hair just loveeees the awapuhi ginger it leaves my hair so clean soft and silky its amazing i highly suggest this line by them the shampoo conditioner mask and dry styling oil i have been rotating this line with my tresemme platinum strength line and my hair has never been better 
2013-08|2.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|didn t hate it but didn t love it either i had hopes this would smell similar to paul mitchell awapuhi shampoo but it did not smell like it at all it didn t wow me i used this in combination with the organix awapuhi conditioner i can t tell that this repairs anything i wouldn t repurchase 
2013-08|1.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i m probably wasting my time writing yet another organix review but oh well ok so the first time i used this shampoo i had awesome results my hair was really soft and felt like i didn t even need to use conditioner which is rare for me regardless i went ahead and used the organix macadamia conditioner with it they were out of the awapuhi conditioner i wanted anyway as soon as i rinsed the conditioner out my hair was like straw awful i mean i don t think i ve ever had a drugstore product dry my hair out so badly not even suave has done this i ve used the awapuhi shampoo a few times since with a different conditioner and i get mediocre results semi dry hair not much shine just kind of blah i will not be repurchasing any organix shampoo or conditioners because i have never found one that works for me 
2013-08|4.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|this shampoo dramatically improves my hair my hair feels softer and healthier after one use i did give it 4 stars though because it will strip the color out of your hair after one use but i do love this product and it smells beautiful 
2012-08|2.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i love the smell of this shampoo and it cleans hair very well but sadly about halfway through the bottle i realized it was stripping my hair colour if i didn t have coloured hair i would stick with it since it seems a pretty decent shampoo but for now i am alternating it with australian organic s normal hair shampoo since alternating shampoos seems to prevent my hair from getting quot used quot to them and i rather like the shade my hair is fading to but don t want it to fade too fast you get a half squeaky clean feeling from wash rinse repeat and paired with the macadamia nut oil conditioner this is some of the best smelling stuff out there nothing miraculous but i enjoy using it edit for those people worried about parabens this shampoo contains dmdm hydantoin http chemicaloftheday squarespace com todays chemical 2009 6 22 dmdm hydantoin html instead which is an even more hazardous preservative so don t buy this thinking you re safe from quot nasty chemicals quot that s just marketing hype still need to read labels 
2012-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i absolutely love this product i bought this shampoo along with the conditioner on friday i love organix products because it s natural and the shampoos contain no sulfates i love the packaging of the bottles amp this stuff smells a m a z i n g at first i wasn t sure which shampoo amp conditioner duo to pick but i eventually decided on this one amp i am so glad i did i just used both today amp oh my gosh it made my hair so soft amp smell so good after i patted my hair with a towel i then applied the organix coconut milk anti breakage serum to the ends of my hair amp my hair is amazingly soft amp shiny amp manageable i highly recommend this shampoo conditioner amp i suggest using the coconut milk serum afterwards 
2012-08|1.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|this shampoo smells delicious and that s about it half way thru this shampoo i noticed that it had dried my hair out like straw and my hair was also shedding like crazy too bad because it made my hair very shiny and healthy looking for a couple of weeks my husband tried it and it had the same effect on his hair edit found out what makes my loose hair like crazy with this shampoo seems this third ingredient is the culprit water sodium c14 16 olefin sulfonate cocamidopropyl betaine
2012-08|1.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|a lot of you think this shampoo is sulfate free but you need to do your research there are still surfactants in this the 2nd one sodium c14 olefin sulfontate is a very harsh surfactant equally as if not more harsh than sls it s no wonder that after just one use my hair color seems faded no wonder this shampoo foams so well the other surfactants in here are gentle it has a water soluble silicone which is nice and doesn t make my hair tangled like the clear scalp therapy shampoo but i m giving this shampoo a bad rap you can t believe all the claims written on the bottles sulfate free doesn t mean safe for colored hair or free or harsh detergents you might want to re think this if you have colored hair a shame because it smells nice and makes my hair clean and light weight without being dry to be fair i ll keep using it for a few weeks and if i notice any color fading i ll definitely know it s the poo and quit it and go on to joico who in addition to using the gentle surfactants uses sodium laureth sulfate sles which is a gentle surfactant that cleans rather well w o being drying or stripping i ve never had issues with sles update had to ditch this the trickster sulfate in here dried my hair out went to joico instead
2012-08|3.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|this is a really lovely thick creamy sulfate free shampoo great lather cleans well and smells fantastic it isn t harsh and does leave a nice shine on my notoriously curly fluffy hair one warning for people with colour treated hair while their website says this shampoo is ok for colour treated hair it most definitely is not it will strip colour like no tomorrow and you will see a difference after a single wash with it it s curious as otherwise it seems a gentle shampoo but whatever is in the ingredients is a serious no no for those with colour i deducted points for that fact if your hair isn t coloured this is great stuff though it s on the pricey end for a drug store shampoo and locally runs about 2 00 more than some of the other shampoos from the organix brand 
2012-08|4.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i really wanted to like this because of all the amazing reviews the first week it worked alright but didn t do much for my hair my hair gets damaged so easily so it needs hard core tlc unfortunately this did not work on my straw like hair but that being said there is a positive part my mom tried this and she loves it she had colored hair and it is somewhat thick it makes her hair soft and shiny 
2012-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|organix sells some of the best smelling products out there and the awapuhi ginger shampoo is no exception the tropical scent is amazing i also love the generous lather which is rare in a sulfate free product overall a terrific shampoo 
2012-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i ve been using this with the conditioner and i looooove it the smell is awesome and not too over powering i has made my hair so soft and it feels very healthy i recommend this for someone with dry hair my fiance tried it and it just made his hair more greasy using this has made me want to try out the paul mitchell awapuhi line but i m a poor college student so that wont be happening so until i can afford a 25 dollar shampoo i will be at the organix section at ulta 
2012-08|2.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i bought this based off of all the glowing reviews here on mua and i was not disappointed i had previously been using l oreal s evercreme shampoo and conditioner but i was starting to notice how flat my hair was because the shampoo wasn t getting rid of any product build up in my hair i dye my hair w permanent color at home every month and recently had an episode that necessitated the use of coloroops darn you feria you turned on me so i think because my hair was extra dry and sad from the abuse evercreme did offer some much needed moisture but soon as my hair got back to normal that s when i saw issues with it i did a lot of research here on mua and this was one of the few drugstore brands that was sulfate free and got high marks for cleansing and repair i bought both the shampoo and conditioner at walgreen s bogo free pretty sweet deal for an 8 shampoo amp conditioner love the scent mild and pretty and love how the shampoo lathers so well i think even though it s sulfate free it lathers enough to cleanse properly the conditioner doesn t seem like it s going to do much for your hair because of its light whipped texture but it does a fantastic job my hair looks so fab and shiny and smells great never been so satisfied with a drugstore shampoo and conditioner i love being able to find products i can buy again and again nothing worse than buying an quot ok quot product and having to start from square one researching what might work better before you can even go to the store and complete your shopping list update started to dry my hair out after the honeymoon period was over 
2012-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i have fine long chemically treated hair and a sensitive nose this shampoo pleased both it smells fantastic and unusual without being perfumey or overpowering and easily works into a lush lather in the shower i m on my third bottle and plan to repurchase despite it being on the higher end of the drugstore brand price range at my local pharmacy it cost me 8 99 
2012-08|4.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i have been using organix products for a while now and i m a big fan of this product as well it made my hair soft and i didn t notice a lot of frizz either the smell is absolutely amazing not a surprise all organix products smell great and is overall a great product 
2012-08|3.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|the main reason i decided to use this shampoo was because it is sulfate free also because my hair is on the split ends side i decided quot why not quot let s see if it works well so far i like it but i do not love it it is a good shampoo and it will leave the hair very soft just after shampooing alone however i see that it does give me a lot of hair fall out every time i do use it that is why i felt like it did not deserve a rating of 4 5 since this could be a big problem for some of us it is something about this organix products and i know is the products because i just started using this line and that is all i ve been using still the shampoo does leave my hair very shiny and healthy looking plus it smells real good 
2012-08|4.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|i ve been wanting to try organix sls free shampoo s for months the one i wanted to try was the cherry blossom ginseng shampoo for volume unfortunately it was all sold out i really needed a sls shampoo so i opted for this one i can say that this shampoo really does make my hair feel nice and soft in and out of the shower the smell is great and so is the packaging but i don t think i can continue using this product for the reason that it makes my hair oily and i loose more hair in the shower i already have an oily scalp that needs to be washed every other day i recommend this product for anyone who is looking for an sls free shampoo and needs something that will soften and moisten their hair however i do not recommend this product to anyone that has an oily scalp be warned 
2012-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|im a huge fan of all organix products when i saw smelled this line i had to try it it definitely works and made my hair soft and stopped breaking love it definitely recommend 
2012-08|4.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|this was the best shampoo conditioner i ever tried from the organix line it didn t make my hair dry and it actually foamed up most sulfate free shampoos don t seem to do much but this one i couldn t even tell it smells greatttttttttt too 
2012-08|5.0| Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo|this shampoo made my wavy coarse hair nice and flowy it smells really good and lathered up nicely for a sulfate free shampoo it didn t strip my red hair color and it made my hair still feel super clean i use it with the matching conditioner or with biolage color shampoo and it works wonderfully with both 
2016-08|1.0|Healing Vitamin E |this stuff is horrible it almost felt like it dried my hair out even more somehow after blow drying my hair once i used this on damp hair my hair was limp dry and fly aways were everywhere 
2015-08|3.0|Healing Vitamin E |i gave it a 3 because it isn t thaaat mediocre like most organix products the scent is okay i like it the consistency is thick but the results are meh i think you could find something better out there i mean it does add some moisture to your hair but it won t go far no matter how much you leave it on for and i have noticed that organix conditioners makeyour hair look more voluminous yet not very soft to the touch and you can see a film on it 
2015-08|2.0|Healing Vitamin E |ok so i ve tried multiple kinds of the organix shampoos and conditioners every single bottle the cap broke off after like the second use i do not care for them at all they leave my hair limp lifeless and greasy i have long blonde hair that is fine for reference they do not add of their claimed benefits to my hair it s not the worst drugstore shampoo and conditioner out there but it isn t for me 
2015-08|4.0|Healing Vitamin E |i am on my second bottle of this conditioner i have to admit i mainly purchase ogx conditioners for how delicious some of them smell my first obsession was repairing awapuhi ginger followed by hydrate defrizz kukui oil but i think this one is by far my favourite it smells very fresh doesn t linger and gives my fine blonde brittle hair just enough hydration to give it movement it s suitable for frequent use as it s not rich enough to leave residue buildup in your hair overall i d say all ogx conditioners have the same degree of just there hydration and detangling but you really have to tailor them to your hair s needs awapuhi is definitely suitable in increasing hair elasticity but won t do much for detangling or smoothing kukui will leave hair mega smooth and shiny but it has tendency to build up this one is most balanced and suitable for managing my split ends and extreme tangling it airs dry my hair straight and holds a curl nicely ogx is inexpensive to begin with but almost always on sale a bottle is nice and narrow so it won t take much space the lid fits tightly but easy to flip open with a thumb by the way shampoo smells almost like nothing at all so i opted for quenched sea mineral moisture shampoo 
2016-08|5.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i was contemplating if i wanted to buy this shampoo or not as my current shampoo dries and makes my hair frizzy i came here to read the reviews and read many bad reviews i was skeptical but i still gave it a shot and i couldn t see why people wouldn t love this product it has a great smell and dosen t dry my hair out at all it feels clean and i love the smell after analysing i realised that this product is not suitable if you have thick and curly hair but if you do not have thick or curly hair this product would be great for you 
2015-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i had both the shampoo and conditioner of this line and was disappointed that i can no longer find it in stores my hair looked and felt very soft and healthy with this shampoo it smelled fruity and wonderful and i loved the bright pink bottle i have somewhat wavy hair and this did not straighten it out too much or make my hair too poofy which a lot of products do if i could find this again i would probably repurchase it
2013-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|it s interesting to me that this product has really mixed reviews i guess it just goes to show that everyone s body and hair react differently this was my first time trying organix i found it on clearance at wal mart i had a pleasant experience with this product from scent to the way it left my hair feeling afterwards i feel like it gave me a nice clean wash i didn t think it dried my hair out i really enjoy my hair the next days after using this based on my experience i would repurchase and even considering trying other shampoos from this brand 
2013-08|1.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|in my local drug store i saw that this product along with the matching conditioner was on sale i figured i d try it because there is no sulfate in either eager to see how it works that night i used it let me just say that this was the worst product i have ever used in my hair my hair felt so coarse as if i had used a bleach in it additional to that the smell was so obnoxious my best friend used both the conditioner and shampoo as well and we both agree that these products are horrible stay away 
2012-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|great smelling shampoo didnt leave my hair as rough as the moraccan argan shampoo from this brand 
2012-08|1.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|ran out of my regular shampoo and conditioner nobody carries it locally anymore and this brand is deceptively similar in name and packaging so i picked this up thinking it was by the same company not so i just can t get past the super strong scent of this shampoo basically it smells like you just dunked your head in a bowl of kool aid fruit punch pixiestix mixture i am unable to go around like that all day the fragrance probably gets a bit stronger in the shower under hot steamy water but i immediately had to wash my hair three times with the only other shampoo within reach dandruff control just to get most of the smell out 
2011-08|5.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i have thin frizzy puffy hair but not anymore this product is amazing i would like to try and get some more things from this product line i have both the shampoo and conditioner which smells amazing d i highly suggest buying this d hope i helped d d d
2011-08|5.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|why you will love it the acai berry avocado shampoo and conditioner has an exotic nutrient luxurious blend of antioxidant rich acai berry extract and guava to instantly nourish amp enrich your hair while avocado proteins add nutrition and balance along with moroccan argan oil to moisturize your tresses and create a shiny smooth frizz free finish the shampoo amp conditioner are sulfate free paraben free and they are organic this product is safe for color treated hair and is safe for all hair types for reference i have damaged dry thick and noncolored hair i have my hair bkt 6 months ago and i started using organix acai berry avocado shampoo and suddenly fell in love with it has an amazing scent and makes me happier while taking shower lathers very nice and it cleans hair and scalp very well in my opinion trick here is using shampoo and conditioner together you should use them together to get better results if you live in europe or usa it has a very reasonble price unlike northern cyprus and turkey so you probably won t complain about the price since a bottle is 20 in northern cyprus and turkey however you need to use more product to clean your hair beacuse it is sulfate free organix won t foam like a sls shampoo this is the only complaint i can make it runs out very fast your hair will love this treat 
2011-08|1.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i bought the shampoo and conditioner buy 1 get 1 and i was so excited to use them i am a shampoo freak and love trying new ones dissapointed isn t the word i have naturally curly thick coarse hair and by the end of my shower i couldn t get a finget through my hair looked ratty tangly but smelled fantastic i read other reviews and thought if i give it some time it might transform my hair soft and smooth nope not even gonna try it anymore 
2011-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i have oily straight hair that i do not use product with nor do i blow dry or straighten this shampoo worked really well for me it balances out my hair and leaves it very soft i also really like the scent the only cons were that the price was high for the amount of product and the packaging is not the best i tried the matching conditioner and i did not feel that it worked as well 
2011-08|5.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|wow cleans my hair so well and it still leaves my hair so moisturized and detangled 
2011-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i bought it and the matching conditioner at rite aid because it was on sale i love the coconut shampoo amp condish from this brand so i figured i d give it a try this smells amazing good enough to eat seriously it lathers well and cleanses well i used the conditioner also and my hair was super soft almost too soft i clipped it up that day and my hair kept sliding out of the clip which never happens from now on i will only use this when i plan on wearing my hair down i love the little short fat bottles from this brand too cute would repurchase if it was on sale again would not pay 6 99 a bottle for it 
2011-08|3.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|pros smells absolutely fabulous lathers really well and leaves hair squeaky clean cons pricey for drugstore shampoo and doesn t moisturize at all kind of a bummer purchase honestly 
2011-08|2.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i liked the smell and the idea of going organic but this shampoo left my hair feeling unclean and dry if i didn t wash my hair the next day my hair became oily i ve never had this problem would love to hear any organic shampoo recommendations 
2011-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i smelled a few different bottles of these at walgreens and i loved all of them i finally settled on this i wasn t crazy about paying 8 for a bottle of shampoo and another 8 for the conditioner what the heck was i thinking but did so anyway i love this shampoo though really lathers up well and leaves my hair soft and smelling wonderful 
2010-08|5.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i never really care about shampoo and i ve always used whatever was in the shower i came across this at cvs and loved the smell so i took it home i love it it made my hair so smooth and shiny it smells very yummy my hair feels clean and very light it latherrs so well to be a parabean and sulfate free shampoo will def keep buying this one 
2010-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|okay first of all i think this may have been reformulated or the person below me got a bad bottle i don t notice any quot pulpy quot texture at all it s just creamy and smooth like any other shampoo it smells wonderful so fruity very quot berry quot the lather is fantastic considering this is a sulfate free shampoo most of the sulfate free shampoos i try are thin runny and don t have much lather this lathers up a treat the only reason this is a 4 out of 5 is because it s not quite as moisturizing quot moisturous quot wtf review below me as you would think a shampoo containing avocado and argan oil would be however i would call this more of a 4 5 than a 4 anyways hair is left feeling clean and my scalp likes it i have very sensitive skin on my scalp so a shampoo that doesn t aggravate it is always a winner as far as my hair type it s fine but i have a lot of it i color and it s what i would call quot normal quot not particularly dry or oily i would definitely buy this again i think for such a large quantity the bottle has like 13 oz in it the price of 7 is fine 
2010-08|2.0|Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo|i had wanted to try organix and the bright pink packaging of this shampoo caught my eye i have used acai products before for my skin for example but never for my hair the shampoo is a very pulpy texture nearly translucent but does not feel terribly moisturous when applied all in all when paired with the conditioner i was not really very impressed 
2016-08|1.0|Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo|i bought the shampoo and conditioner and used it once i have thick wavy coarse shoulder length hair first thing the smell is pretty good and didn t set off my migraines but after getting out of the shower and as my hair air dried it felt like straw this morning it felt just as bad if not worse and i returned these 
2015-08|1.0|Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo|feels like i washed my hair with sudsy mud gross into the rubbish bin it goes 
2014-08|1.0|Hydrate + Repair Argan Oil of Morocco Shampoo|this is the review for the new organix ogx hydrate repair argan oil of morocco shampoo that i just noticed at the grocery store this shampoo has a pleasant fragrance similiar to most argan oil products from various brands this shampoo left my hair very soft and with some shine however not even by dinner time my hair was really oily and greasy looking from root to ends i have really dry and frizzy hair so i was really surprised that this shampoo would give me these results i did not use the matching conditioner so i am not sure what the final results would of been with the hydrate repair argan oil of morocco shampoo conditioner combination 
2016-08|5.0|Argan Oil and Shea Butter Moisture Restore Mask|it makes my hair feel very soft and reduces tangles however it does have oil in it so don t use too much of it or you ll might end up washing your hair again its smell isn t amazing it isn t too oily of a product though 
2015-08|2.0|Argan Oil and Shea Butter Moisture Restore Mask|i had held high hopes for the product considering it had argan oil in it however i was disappointed with very ho hum results the product is a thickish white cream with a rather nice scent it applied and combed through my hair smoothly and rinsed out easily something i always look for in a conditioner it made my hair feel neither better nor worse maybe a little softer but certainly no marked change i wanted to be fair so i used it twice more still nothing it was a little pricey especially for results or lack thereof there a many treatments available that are half the price and work twice as well pros nice smell and feel cons made no improvement to my hair pricey for what it is 
2014-08|3.0|Argan Oil and Shea Butter Moisture Restore Mask|the organix hair mask is a mediochre product i won t deny that it works fine as a conditioning treatment but i get more out of a cheap albeit revolting diy avocado and egg hair mask the product didn t make my hair especially soft or shiny so you might as well buy regular conditioner for half the price 
2013-08|4.0|Argan Oil and Shea Butter Moisture Restore Mask|this is a great product i was worried that it would be too heavy for my hair because the consistency of the product is a very solid cream but it goes on easily and a small amount left on my hair after my regular conditioner leaves the silkiest and most well conditioned feeling the cost of the product is on the higher end for drugstore products around 7 or 8 dollars but it s so heavy that you only need a little if you have normal hair that isn t too coarse 
2013-08|4.0|Argan Oil and Shea Butter Moisture Restore Mask|i didn t think i was going to like this but ended up loving it it has a creamy coconut scent that has decent longevity once my hair dries and has a yellow pudding like consistency it soaks in well and rinses clean without making my hair feel greasy it leaves my hair feeling very soft and with great texture while it isn t the most moisturizing treatment i have ever used it doesn t dry out my hair or leave my hair with static or frizzy ends it gives just enough moisture if that makes sense i noticed better results when i leave it in more i d say for ten to fifteen minutes the only thing i can really complain about is that it comes in a jar and it makes it difficult for me to use in the shower since i hate to get any water in it it is a bit pricey at 8 99 for the size of the jar also 
2013-08|4.0|Argan Oil and Shea Butter Moisture Restore Mask|for a long time i avoided organix products amp now that i ve actually tried them i m in love my hair has been really dry from a harsh winter and i ve been trying a lot to try amp restore some moisture into my hair i m glad i found this because it is a very rich and thick hair mask that just melted into my hair from the first use it really improved the overall health and softness of my hair it smells great amp the scent lasts even hours after the wash my only issue is i feel that the container is too small it s about 8 amp i just feel that there should be a little bit more but oh well i am hooked and plan to try the whole long together very soon 
2016-08|4.0|Moroccan Curling Perfection Defining Cream|i alternate this with my treseme sea salt spray and i noticed how defined my curl looks compared to treseme the curl holds much longer than the latter without heat my only problem with this is it makes my hair quite oily but nevertheless i love it and will definitely repurchase 
2014-08|4.0|Moroccan Curling Perfection Defining Cream|love the product hate the packaging the product clumps up beneath the opening so it won t close properly i do really like the product i have used a lot of curling creams and this one is definitely my favorite i have thick wavy hair and this makes it really soft and also shiny i rub a small amount between my palms and scrunch it in my towel dry hair and repeat this a few times and let it air dry or use a diffuser it doesn t do much against frizz though 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Curling Perfection Defining Cream|yes i have been looking for an ultimate curl cream and i found it it is weightless smells great and works soooo well that i feel good about my hair all day long i have thin long and wavy asian hair i got a clinical hair perm several months ago and i love it but it just seemed like that wonderful looking curl could not last all day then i found it in a drug store and decided to give it a try man this stuff works it just holds the curl really well and my hair looks like it just has been freshly styled throughout the day silk therapy is pretty close to it but that one feels a bit too heavy and sticky to my liking this bad boy will be my staple period 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Curling Perfection Defining Cream|finally an hg curl defining product the search has ended ladies i am picky about what products i put in my hair mostly because my hair is picky about which products it will accept it truly has a mind of its own i have thick wavy middle eastern hair that if left to its own devices will go every which way undefined quot blah quot waves and little definition i don t use any other hair products as long as i have this gem on hand after washing my hair and squeezing out excess water i use a little bit little goes a long way on damp hair scrunching my hair till i get the desired look after air drying i m left with beautiful soft nicely defined waves that feel natural and light not at all crunchy or weighed down the trick is to only use as much as you need for your hair type and length and not more an added bonus is the incredible scent which lasts and is not too heavily perfumed or artificial and the light lotion like consistency i also love that my hair still feels okay the day after so i can wash my hair out every other day without feeling like it s too dirty sticky grimy like with some other hair products try this curly wavy haired ladies affordable and available at cvs it s hard to find elsewhere unless you opt to buy online you ll probably end up loving it too 
2016-08|5.0|Anti-hair fallour Niacin3 & Caffiene Root Stimulator|i have been using this product a few times a week at night and the matching shampoo for a month now i have noticed baby hairs growing around my hair line 
2015-08|3.0|Anti-hair fallour Niacin3 & Caffiene Root Stimulator|i noticed no benefits from using this hair product due to hormone issues my hair is thinning and i used this root stimulator and the matching shampoo the root stimulator did not irritate my scalp but i noticed no increased hair growth nor any decrease in hair loss 
2015-08|5.0|Quenching Coconut Curls Frizz-Defying Moisture Mousse|for reference my hair is very fine wavy 2a amp overly processed from years of straightening drying and dying my hair was looking so limp i was browsing walgreens for new products to try out when this quenching coconut curls line caught my attention at first i bought the hair butter amazing see separate review for that and i was so impressed i wanted to try this out too this in conjunction with the hair butter as a leave in is perfection my hair has so much body bounce curls i didn t even know i had came out of the wood works i love that it leaves my hair soft and natural looking not hard stiff and quot wet quot looking its a light foamy texture with a delicious light coconut scent 2 pumps is all my hair needs and the bottle is fairly large with alot of product i can t wait to try out the shampoo and conditioner from this line next 
2015-08|5.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Therapy Conditioner|love this stuff the smell is amazing rich mouth watering passionfruit the conditioner is extremely thick which was intimidating at first as i have very fine hair it s more like a body butter than a conditioner which means that if you spread it over your palms and between your fingers you get a more controlled application i only ever condition from my ears down to the tips as my scalp is prone to the greasies speaking of my scalp my itchy sore scabby lumps have totally gone since i ve been using these products sls i think you and i need to break up i alternate using these products with the richer ever straight brazilian keratin therapy s amp c from organic i m not crazy about the scent but i love the results and my hair is wavy full of body and is soft and silky can t rave enough about these products 
2014-08|4.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i love the smell of this and how smooth it leaves my hair i enjoy keratin based products and this is pretty affordable it gives good shine and texture in the shower i think it provides good slip and my hair was easy to detangling afterwards i wouldn t use this daily since this could cause build up for me but i like this conditioner and the matching hair oil too it seems to help with frizz and keep flyways to a minimum 
2014-08|5.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i used to swim four times a week and because of the high amount of choline in the pools i always got split ends i went to the store to try some new shampoo because my old one just didnt do anything great for my hair i decided to try the organix brand because my friend suggusted it to me i am sooo glad she told me about this product my hair is naturally straight with just a little bit of wave and frizz at the bottom and now thanks to this product my hair is smooth shiny and i no longer have a problem with split ends i totally recomend this to anybody who wants to get rid of frizz and hair breakage i also have the shampoo and i love that as well 
2013-08|3.0|Anti-Breakage Keratin Therapy Conditioner|i love the organix brand overall i decided to try this new product of theirs because i get severe split ends and i was interested in keratin treatment this conditioner has a light pleasant but unidentifiable sent it is not a creamy as i typically prefer a conditioner to be due to the oil base i did not like that it left an oily residue on my skin that was difficult to wash off afterwards it was a passable conditioner for my long thick wavy hair but i will be going back to one of my old favorites because after several weeks of use i did not see a noticable difference in the reduction of split ends or breakage 
2015-08|4.0|Healing + Vitamin E penetrating oil|overall i really like this oil so far i ve had the product for about three weeks now and i can definitively say that it has helped stop my hair loss in conjunction to using the oil i have started using the biotin collagen shampoo by organix also and have been taking biotin and vitamin e capsules i use this oil the night before i wash my hair by massaging my scalp then applying the rest through my ends it definitely makes a beneficial difference and you can t go wrong for the price i dont like the packaging though i wish it came with a pump for convenience 
2015-08|5.0|Healing + Vitamin E penetrating oil|i love this stuff i bought it on a whim once i realized my hair has been kinda acting weird lately i ve been straightening it a bit more and it s just been kinda knotty and dry i have very long hair a little past my boobs haha well i bought this and ever since i started using it no more knots and my hair has felt sooooo soft it s also really shiny but i only put this on the ends i apply a very small amount from a little past mid length to the ends and my hair becomes very easy to brush and just luscious if you haven t had luck with it maybe try applying less literally a small amount goes a long way i would buy this again 
2015-08|4.0|Healing + Vitamin E penetrating oil|i am really enjoying this product it smells amazing and leaves my hair soft my hair is fine and very damaged due to years of bleaching dyeing and heat styling it leaves my hair shiny and smooth and the best part is that i can out it on dry hair yes i just put a small amount on my second day ends and voila smooth as the day i first washed styled them 
2015-08|2.0|Healing + Vitamin E penetrating oil|this is bit too heavy for me but it does soften well it doesn t perform well in low dew points for me unfortunately i think it smells great fruity like something from bath and body works i smelled before i don t think it pairs well under a gel but a styling cream works well the macadamia and awapuhi oil in the line work better for me 
2015-08|2.0|Healing + Vitamin E penetrating oil|my hair usually responds really well to vitamin e which is why i spent a bit of time deciding whether i should give this a go as i find organix products a bit hit and miss i had seen good reviews on the internet for this so i thought it would probably be okay well it was just kind of weird i didn t really get any moisture from it and it just made my hair feel stiff like i d lightly sprayed my hair with hair spray like my fingers would get stuck when i ran them through my hair so it didn t really do anything terrible to my hair but i m not someone who uses hair spray so i didn t like the feel and was looking forward to washing it out kind of wish i didn t waste my money 
2015-08|5.0|Biotin & Collagen Weightless Healing Oil Treatment|i have fine hair and was worried this oil treatment would weigh it down but i have been so impressed i don t know what magic is in this oil but it truly seems to give my hair more texture and somehow fullness also i am addicted to the scent which subtly lingers i use this after the conditioner also amazing this is amazing stuff a little goes a long way after a long period using aveda pure abundance i feel this range of hair products is my new holy grail 
2014-08|5.0|Biotin & Collagen Weightless Healing Oil Treatment|whoa this is a wonderful soothing oil treatment for dry and brittle hair i didn t have high hopes for this product it s an oil after all i expected it to weigh down my hair and make it very greasy nope it adds shine tames frizz and deeply nourishes my chemical treated hair you only need a very little bit so it ll last a long time 
2014-08|2.0|Biotin & Collagen Weightless Healing Oil Treatment|i tried this product for several weeks with high hopes for a protein product with this thick amp full biotin amp collagen weightless healing oil treatment you get what you pay for economical but ineffective the only difference is it adds shine to your hair which you could easily get with olive or coconut oil 
2014-08|5.0|Biotin & Collagen Weightless Healing Oil Treatment|this product is amazing i have low porosity curly hair which loves this product it is light weight and nourishing 
2014-08|5.0|Biotin & Collagen Weightless Healing Oil Treatment|i only review products that i love and this is a new favorite a few years ago my moroccan oil habit was getting too expensive and i decided to try other oil options after trying too many oil s to count i stumbled upon the organix line now goes by ogx at my local walmart i tried the argan oil treatment with great results and have used it faithfully for the past 2 years when i was stocking up the other day i noticed a new oil in their product line and this is it after 1 week of using it i am in love it is so lightweight and doesn t give me greasy roots after 2 days of not washing it smells sweet like candy makes my hair shiny and so so soft and made flat ironing my long curly hair a breeze i have no residue or build up and i only wash my hair every 3 days price was 5 64 for a bottle that will last me 2 months 
2015-08|3.0|Hydrate and Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|the smell reminded me of something but couldn t put my finger on it out ah ha vanilla fields perfume from back in the day inital thoughts smells good starts off like a pudding consistency but thins out quickly once it is mixed with water or put onto the hair for my long hair i need quite a bit to cover all of it and even then it is not coated well product does not have much slip if any at all in order to receive any conditioning benefit i have to use a lot of product and leave at least 3 5 minutes also in order to have any smoothng effect i need to apply high on my head starting above the ears it did hydrate my hair but did not offer any detangling the first couple of days i noticed my hair seemed a bit weighed down but not too bad and at first it did nothing for frizz after two weeks my hair is no longer weighed down even though i am now using more product and it has helped to smooth down some of the frizz it has not eliminated it by any means but i am ok with the overall result i do not even need a smoothing product anymore whatever frizz is left i can smooth out with the blowdyer and brush over time my hair looked healthier and shiny but because of the tangles my hair is now breaking due to brushing it out so it was counteracting the benefits overall i will not repurchase because for the price and size of the bottle i have to use way too much of this on my hair and due to the tangles it is causing more damage even though my hair was soft and shiny tried on my daughters hair and her hair looked very shiny almost shimmery too bad it does not detangle 
2013-08|5.0|Hydrate and Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner|o m g i found this tonight and wow i am a huge fan of organix and my hg shampoo and conditioner and deep mask is from their cocoa butter line this one is my runner up this controlled my curls and waves like crazy and made it super soft this is a little different than my hg one in that is defines my curls more instead of relaxes them mega shine and total control over frizz and dryness great conditioner that leaves your hair super soft and slick great shampoo and i tried the other products in the line too all are a great product highly recommend 
2015-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|thus product smelled nice but did nothing good for my hair it left my long hair feeling dirty and almost sticky there was no shine and it tangled terribly i m glad it works for some people but sadly hair did not agree with it at all 
2015-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|did nothing for my hair smells nice but it left my hair feeling tangled and stringy definitely did nothing for split ends 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|this is an excellent leave in conditioner i have a lot of fine highlighted blonde hair and this makes it more manageable and silky the smell is insanely good and it s cheap 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender| __reviewtextreadmorev2__ data enableyoutubepreview true data productid 115180 data reviewid 2605529 data text there is no such thing as a product that can truly mend split ends but this does work well as a leave in conditioner i apply this to my towel dried hair focusing on the ends which are quite damaged this is quite thick so only a small amount is needed it makes my normally coarse hair smooth and soft it also smells delicious i use this frequently and it seems that the texture of my hair has quite improved i absolutely love organix products and this is another winner i plan on trying the coconut shampoo and conditioner once my tea tree mint duo have run out there is no such thing as a product that can truly mend split ends but this does work well as a leave in conditioner i apply this to my towel dried hair focusing on the ends which are quite div
2013-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|we all know nothing can cure split ends without cutting them off but i do like how this stuff makes my hair feel and look more healthy i have severe damaged dry hair and after one use of this it did make my hair look less fryed and the smell is awesome love it and it last all day 
2013-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|this is really good for my split ends and i can reapply again during the day or the next day i dont shampoo my hair everyday it compliments with the conditioner really well it does build up a bit after a couple days but nevertheless it works really well at moisturizing and leaving hair soft i always like to combine leave in creams with serums i was using one with argon oil proclaim argon oil serum but noticed argon oil darkened my natural hair i found at sally s hair chemist coconut oil hair serum and bought it the combination of the 3 works amazing i will review the hair chemist coconut oil hair serum as well i dont know if i will purchase all three again because i like alternating and at times my hair changes but it is something i would purchase again 
2013-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i absolutely love the smell of this the product does seem to help with split ends but not as much as i d like it too 
2013-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i just used up my first bottle of this and overall i really liked it it smells amazing and overall does a good job at keeping split ends from forming the only problem with this product is that when my hair was dryer it was not moisturizing enough i swim a lot during the summer and the chlorine takes a toll on my hair and this did not keep my hair from being a dry mess i would repurchase it except that it is hard to find this where i live 
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|it seems my hair works better with coconut milk and oil this is the only split end product that i have used and noticed results it smells amazing and leaves my hair soft i recommend this product 100 
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|my hair loves this product i have 3c hair that is color treated i dye it black i use about a egg sized amount on towel dried hair and let it air dry i have no frizz my hair is not weighed down and it is super shiny it does mend my split ends but i know it is purely cosmetic from the egg white protein i feel the protein in this does make your hair somewhat stronger however if you are protein sensitive i would avoid this product 
2012-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|well start with the positives the smell is great i do like that the split ends seemed to be a little bit more mended when i started using it however after a few weeks of news nothing else changed and the split ends seemed to be getting worse instead of better in fact my hair started to feel coated and gross i finally tossed it and started to use tresemme in place of the organix and it works a lot better it s strange because i ve used all sorts of products and my hair has never felt so coated as it did with this one smell s great but the product s not worthwhile if it doesn t work
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i bought this cause my friend recommended to me amp i love it it s only my second time using it but i can tell it s done wonders i have a lot of split ends and it makes then unnoticeable it smells great too i think i paid 5 dollars for it which is a great price it s also makes me hair very soft i would buy this if i was you it s great
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|this product smells sooo good and it really helped me with my ends in protecting and sealing them this wasnt to expensive and the products really lasts a long time i def recommend even to try it atleast once 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|this stuff is a miracle worker i bought this product because i had really wanted to try coconut oil but thought it would probably be to heavy for my hair so i got this instead as i had liked the organix coconut deep conditioner i wasn t expecting a product that would quot mend split ends quot because no product can do that i just wanted something that would make my hair smooth and smell nice but omg was i impressed lately past few months my hair has been getting really tangled and knotted all over after a few hours of doing it it didn t matter if i curled my hair or straightened it or anything but i was getting these massive rats nests that would take literally 20 minutes to brush out and were the biggest pain in the butt after just 1 use of this product i have no tangles what so ever none i can t even explain how happy i am my hair stays smooth and knot free the whole day i love it and can t explain enough how much this has helped with preventing split ends as the knots would often break my hair as well as keeping my hair looking nice i don t ever want to stop using this because my hair will go back to looking so knotted and messy bottom line this product isn t going to mend split ends nothing will but i would for sure recommend this to anyone who needs help taming and smoothing hair 
2011-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i blow dry my hair everyday along with straightening on most days initially this product really impressed me as my hair was noticeably softer after using it i wasn t able to go a day without spraying my hair with it however after a couple months of use the treatment became less effective and my hair started reverting back to its state when i don t use the product i ve now stopped using the treatment and probably won t go back to it 
2011-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i have really damaged split end prone hair and ive been really trying to grow it out lately but i have too many split ends so i decided to give this product a go and it works pretty well it makes my hair smell amazing and i did notice a big decline in the split ends on my hair and it is great as an anti frizzer if needed this product will not heal all of your split ends so dont expect that when purchasing get a trim with all the split ends off and then use this product it does a good job at keeping them away 
2011-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i liked this the first time i used it then after a while it made my ends have a really weird texture it was like a gummy texture how someone else described in another review i m not a big fan of organix products so i should ve known better before buying this it s going in the trash waste of 6 
2011-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|this has really reduced the number of split ends i have after washing my hair i pump the product into my hands rub my hands together then smooth it down the lower half of my hair it s inexpensive too 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|mmmm i love the smell and it works so good my hair if i put enough on it looks like i got a haircut paid i think 6 i love it always rebuy 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|recently my hair has had a lot of breakage and split ends instead of cutting it because i love my length i decided to buy some repair products i used this spray along with the new pantene shampoo amp conditioner for breakage amp split ends and my hair feels amazing it s super soft and silky and my split ends are literally gone after spraying this on my wet hair i combed it through with a pick and it went through like butter after blow drying i was shocked at how soft my hair was after just one use i have yet to try this product with any other shampoo but when coupled with the pantene breakage products it works amazing smells amazing too 
2011-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i use this product about 3 4 times per week it smells good but after months of use the ends of my hair have a gummy feel the hair isn t dried out and i don t have split ends however i probably will get it trimmed soon just to get rid of the strange texture 
2011-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i ve only used this twice on my hair after a shower but i love it already this made my hair sooooo soft when my hair dries i couldn t stop touching my hair and the smell it s to freaking die for it is so good but not overpowering if you don t like coconuts you won t like this as fir the splitend mending powers that is probably not true i cut off my split ends at a salon whenever i get my hair cut and i wanted a split end mender just to prevent split ends this might work for that but i m not sure yet but don t buy this if you actually think it will cure your split ends it definitely won t nothing will except for cutting your split ends 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|awesome product i have thick wavy hair that always looks frizzy but when i use this it makes my hair nice and silky will totally buy again
2011-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|very dissapointed many people that use this notice that their hair is softer after using it well sure thats true but it doesnt resolve the problem isnt this for curing split ends not for curing dry hair so this did not take away my split ends but it did make my hair softer for about a week now my hair is reeeally frizzy at the ends and hard to manage i hate this product with a passion it was not even worth the 8 or 9 dollars i spent 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|my hair gets knotted like crazy and i have split quot middles quot as well as ends this product has made my hair soft and my hair doens t tangle completely anymore i m really impressed got this at walmart for 5 or 6 bucks love the packaging and how you can lock the dispenser cap i also really love the smell doesn t leave hair feeling greasy love 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i needed something for my thick frizzy hair to help protect it of the constant straightener and hair dryer use i was very pleased with it i have been using it since february and it has done more then i thought it would have done not only did it give protection from split ends but it also made my hair very smooth and have a healthy shine to it many say to only use on pump or else it will get greasy it does do that i accidentally used to much on my bangs and they became a little greasy but i have to use three or more pumps because i have a lot of hair so i just stay clear of running it through my bangs untill the end when i have a little left over on my hands but over a really good product to by even though it was a little expensive for a poor college student but i dont care cause my hair health it just as important 
2011-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|my hair is naturally very straight fine and a bit volume less i don t have oily or dry hair i do blow dry my hair almost everyday and since i m trying to grow my hair out i wanted something extra to protect the ends of my hair i ve never had split ends to my knowledge but it was something to consider because i don t plan on getting another haircut for another few months before trying this product out i used rusk sensories passionflower leave in conditioner and sometimes i would mix in a little biosilk and apply it on the ends of my hair when it was damp i was hoping that this would be a cheaper alternative the first couple days i used this i noticed that my hair was a lot softer however after a couple days of use i noticed that my hair was incredibly dry and frizzy it had never been this dry before and i didn t know what was causing it i deep conditioned it and even after my hair was still very dry it felt like straw then i realized that the only thing i changed about my hair routine was adding this product once i stopped using this product my hair took about 2 3 days to get back to normal the smell of this product is pretty strong i don t generally like the smell of coconut scented products because usually it s overpowering stuffy and heavy this was no different there have been few products that i ve found that are coconut scented but light and refreshing i did like the packaging but because the pump is so short it takes several pumps to get enough product out i had really high hopes about this product because it is organic and i ve heard some good things about their coconut conditioner however this really didn t work me hope this helps you guys 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i love this stuff it smells amazing and makes my hair so much softer then it has ever been i have thick curly hair and that is hard to do i would say you see this buy it 
2011-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|the first time i used this i felt like it really dried out my hair so i took off one lippie for that but after that i ve really grown to love this product i m trying to grow my hair out but it spilts so easily that i really wanted to try something that claims to mend spilt ends so that i could go longer between haircuts now that i ve been using this for a few weeks i ve noticed a real difference in my hair it s softer and it still looks like i just got my hair cut i ve noticed that there are fewer split ends in my hair now which is great i m thinking about trying out the rest of the coconut milk line because this has worked great edit to add ok after about two months i noticed my split ends were running rampant in my hair i ve also grown very tired of the really strong scent i took a break from it and then tried again but this time around it did nothing for me gave it away to my sister who wanted to try it and it s working for her 
2011-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i was natural for about a year and 1 2 and just started back perming 2mnths ago got a nice cut also but still had some spilt ends that just felt awful after i did my hair i purchased this product on sunday it stated to apply to towel dried hair and i d just did my hair that morning so what did i do applied it to my ends anyway even though it wasn t wet felt the difference immediately i apply it to the ends nightly hair fills like it made a difference i don t like the smell of coconut in my or anyone else hair so i resisted coconut anything for years hope i continue to see improvement 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|when used properly this product is excellent and does exactly as it says if you use too much you will end up with an unflattering greasy sticky head i have thick natural type 4 coils so about half a pump on wet hair before twisting makes for a really nice and well defined twistout i also like that organix products can be used with other brands without that nasty flaky residue you can sometimes get from mixing brands 
2011-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i will always buy this product it makes my hair soft and much more manageable i straighten my hair everyday and it makes the straight last way longer the smell is strong but if you don t use a lot you barely notice it after a while 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|amazing amazing amazing been using it for about six months now and i can t tell you enough about the difference it has made in my hair my hair care routine has been reduced to sulphate free shampoo and organic conditioner this split end mender and macedamia oil and i m telling you it all works beautifully together would definitely repurchase again and again and again 
2010-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i decided to purchase this after reading the reviews here let me say that i was not disappointed this stuff left my hair feeling soft and manageable it has keratin protein that masks split ends which is nice and the coconut oil bans frizz and leaves it sooooo soft the only negative is that it has a very strong scent it reminds me of sun tan oil but if you don t cake your hair in this stuff it s not that bad is not that expensive i think i got mine at walgreens for about 8 well worth it 
2010-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|scent is really really strong you have to really like the smell of coconut to want to use it it reminds me of suntan lotion packaging is nice you turn the pump to lock and turn it back to unlock leaves your hair shiny feels very moisturized and mends your split ends to the point where it looks like you just got a fresh haircut highly recommend if you can handle the scent cause it will linger in your hair for awhile 
2010-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|this stuff made my hair sticky and hard to comb through also tangle easily its a bit more expensive but trust me its way more worth it to buy regis desing line silk repair and shine silk drops oh and i also didnt see any improvement with my split ends after using it for weeks straight 
2010-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i started using this product 2 days ago and i really like it the consistency is amazing not to oily or greasy and the smell is wonderful i don t know about the mending split ends but it does seem to make my hair a little less frizzy and more healthy 
2010-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i don t like it at all it smells bad and it s not smoothing it s kind of gunky the scent stays all night i can smell it in the morning or hours after shower sorry no one likes this review but that s my opinion it sucks 
2010-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|this product really surprised me i bought it because i was looking for a dupe to joico k pak split end mender but i didn t want to spend that much i ended up finding this in wal mart and tried it i just want to clarify that this product does not repair split ends unfortunately i have not found a product that does such a thing however i do use this after i get trims on my hair and i feel like it prevents split ends because i use a lot of heat to style my hair and since using this product i have noticed healthier ends the scent is absolutely gorgeous if you like coconuts and i love the fact that its organic i ve never used the joico k pak split end mender but this works well for me so why spend more money overall im impressed 
2010-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i feel this does help my hair against split ends but i like their anti breakage serum better although this product does work and does smell great i just think the serum works a bit better for split ends 
2010-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i can t believe all the good things i m hearing about this product i ve been using it for 3 years i don t know why i use it its just still there and i want to get rid of it and i have so many aplit ends they never end my solution a trim although to be honest i haven t tried other split end products so i have nothing to compare to but i will never buy any organix products ever again 
2010-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i absolutely love this product after suffering a nightmare split ends phase from this summers heat wave this saved my hair after my trim i love the smell and the nice texture it gives my hair it doesn t leave my hair greasy looking feeling at all during and at the end of the day i also love the pump off and on switch it doesn t squirt a lot at all and gives you great control of how much product you want i apply this on the ends and tips of my layers love it 
2010-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|let me start by saying this did wonders for my hair i have never tried a product that made my hair softer smoother or straighter it seriously got rid of all the frizzy fly aways and left me with silky soft hair that smelt delicious but after a month or so of using this my neck started to itch terribly and a blotchy red rash appeared i was devestated i tried cutting this product out of my routine to see if it was what was causing the irritation and the rash went away one day i was having a terribly bad hair day so i put this in on my way out the door bad idea i the burning rash was back i have no idea what ingredient in this prodcut caused the rash but i had to stop using it if you don t have sensitive skin or you are willing to put up with a rash if one occurs this is a fabulous hair product if you re on the fence i say get it because it s so cheap 
2010-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|mmm this stuff is amazing i applied after towel drying and before i bow dried i could tell this was going to be something good when it dried it felt amazing my hair was super soft and shiny and looked super healthy plus the coconut smell is amazing and still lingers a tad after being dried all the way i hope this stuff stays around forever 
2010-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i think i could eat this stuff but i guess i ll settle for nice smelling shiny hair 
2010-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|my friend actually bought this bottle and gave it to me as she did not like the product at all the smell is very nice and the pump makes dispensing the product very easy the product itself is pretty sticky but if applied sparingly on just the ends it does seem to minimize the frizzies not completely sold on it so don t know that i d buy another bottle on my own after i finish this one 
2009-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|as i said in my other review i use this product along with organix coconut milk anti breakage serum in my damp hair and after two weeks i can tell they ve done amazing things for my hair its less frizzy super silky and smells amazing i can t swear to its split end mending abilities but my hair does look healthier and i will definitely be continuing use i highly recommend it 
2009-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|smells great and makes hair soft and smooth would definetly buy again 
2009-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|okay this product is so amazing i have so many high end hair treatments by fekkai redken pureology ojon and so many other brands none of them compare to this first off the smell is so amazing just like coconuts but not too overpowering it leaves your hair so soft and somehow it also molds waves some days my hair looks great while others it doesnt but this product makes it look perfect every day and usually when i straighten it i have so many visible split ends that look sort of white at the ends and this makes them compleatly dissapear also makes straightening so much easier deff will repurchase best hair treatment ever 
2009-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i actually really like this while the matching shampoo amp conditioner didn t work out for me this really has i rediscovered it a few days ago in my hair products bin amp have been using it ever since it smells amazing i wish the scent lingered but it doesn t i only use 2 pumps on my long fine hair and it doesn t weigh it down it just makes it soft 
2009-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|i bought this product at random and only because it has coconut in it it was cheap too so if i didn t like it it really wasn t a huge loss i ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and i really do love it it smells really nice and i use about 6 pumps of the stuff on the ends of my hair and it truly does help out with the split ends at least minimizing them and making my hair much smoother and more manageable i don t normally straighten my hair but when i did after using this product i saw an improvement in it the split ends were hardly noticeable and my hair in general felt much more smooth and laid a lot better and my hair felt a lot easier to straighten as well i will repurchase and may even get the shampoo conditioner as well 
2009-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Split End Mender|this product is amazing i wear 18 quot extensions that tend to get frizzy and tangle if i don t use smoothing products and brush them out often i use 2 3 pumps of this on my hair in the morning and at night works on either wet or dry hair and then comb it out and it keeps the ends of my hair smooth and silky plus the scent is to die for it s a little bit sticky but if you don t use too much and brush it through your hair well it doesn t seem to be a problem it s a bit expensive for a drug store brand i think i paid 6 but you get a nice sized bottle of good quality product 
2015-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i did like the scent and the no sulfates intrigued me one word sums it up for me nope never again this shampoo doesn t leave any scent at all and i do have to admit i love scent to stay in my super long hair after i shower it didn t it was also a bitch to comb my hair out afterwards geez i ve never had those kinds of manageability issues before it was awful idk maybe my hair needs the sulfates or whatever was missing from this shampoo amp conditioner team anyway i am done messing with organix i am thru i ve tried a few different types and they all suck as a native chick with long wavy thick hair i am something of a shampoo amp conditioner connoisseur i have at least 20 different types in my bathroom and i am always rotating them so my hair doesn t get use to anything works so far for me anyway i really dislike the organix line of hair care it s hyped up but nothing is really there boo 
2015-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i was intrigued once i saw cherry blossom not impressed scent was pretty poor and not so great no rejuvenating happening and i would not repurchase 
2015-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i wanted to try this for the volume i like some of their other products i used this and it dries out my hair something awful yes i have shine but there really isn t a volume trade off with this i used it with a coconut conditioner which is supposed to give light feeling hydration to the hair what a joke i need to return this 
2014-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|smells divine but leaves my hair too dry this howevers works wonders on my cousin s long pin straight hair the conditioner was awful for both of us though 
2014-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|completely dried out my hair but it didn t even clean it my hair was still dirty but it was so dry that i could not even get a brush through it it smells nice though this may work for some people but not me and i don t like that the brand is called organix but the product is loaded with chemicals their products are not organic at all 
2014-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this is hands down my favorite drugstore shampoo and it has been in my product rotation for a couple of years now it smells great does not contain harsh sulfates but lathers really well does not contain heavy oils that can weigh down my hair and is always on sale somewhere bogo anyone i have thick wavy curly hair so moisture retention is a must i alternate this with nature s gate jojoba shampoo or whatever other jojoba based sls free shampoo i can get my hands on i don t use the cherry blossom conditioner as i never quot pair quot shampoos and conditioners 
2014-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|pretty awful product i was so disappointed when returning this shampoo because it smelled wonderful claimed to provide volume without harsh stripping and i ve had good experiences with organix products before this product completely dehydrated my hair and didn t even add any volume volumizing shampoos tend to dry hair a little due to the alcohols in the ingredients that add volume but i have never experienced a volume shampoo as drying as this one probably the reason i didn t see any volume was because my hair was so damaged and stripped of all moisture by this shampoo it couldn t be manageable i even double conditioned my hair with my usual conditioner not the one from this line which i never have to do since my hair is pretty short and it still was a wiry bundle of straw for reference i have naturally wavy fine textured dry hair that is colored and heat styled i have read on some other reviews that this shampoo can be drying and instruct to use it every other time you wash but i would recommend this shampoo for people with oily hair that does not get dried out or dehydrated easily because i only wash my hair 3 4 times per week due to its natural dryness and this shampoo only exacerbated my hair s natural lack of moisture i tend to find that i am either impressed with organix products and repurchase them at least once or i absolutely despise them and return them asap i love the argan oil hair mist the coconut oil spray and the brazilian keratin hair mist by organix i know this is not related to this specific product review but just thought i would share which organix products i like hopefully this review was helpful and i hope others using this will have better luck than i did 
2013-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|if you re suffering from thin hair or androgenetic alopecia this shampoo is a godsend seriously i have been battling thinning lifeless dull stringy crappy hair for 5 years due to menopause and androgenetic alopecia i ve lost 50 percent of the hair i was once blessed with i have spent a fortune on every product out there that claims to help with such this is the only shampoo i ve found that improves the thickness volume and texture of my hair i buy it by the case on amazon for fear that the company will some day discontinue it or change the formula like so many companies do organix if you re reading please please don t ever do away with this product or change anything about it i will say that i m not a big fan of the conditioner it leaves my hair too tangled and frizzy i use pantene volume conditioner i use it sparingly and it detangles my hair and takes care of most of the frizz without weighing it down another thing that has drastically helped my pathetic aging hair is that i quit having my hair professionally colored even the top salons were damaging my hair probably due to the fact that i couldn t get it through their heads that thin aging hair processes way faster than normal hair i now color my own hair with sally s agebeautiful line i know some of you are cringing right now and i only process it for half the time even you young girls with thinning hair would benefit from using agebeautiful 
2013-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|so i will edit this review as i experience the product buying the product it is a cute bottle and wonderful smell washing for the first time i just washed my hair with it and my hair smells and looks wonderful not tangling at all and seems soft and manageable so far 5 stars i hope it keeps my hair clean and non oily for the next 24 hours 24hrs after washed still soft and manageable no tangles throughout the day and my hair did not get super greasy by the end of the day like some shampoos do with my hair also i kept breaking out on my forehead from my last shampoo and so far no new acne with this shampoo so still 5 stars see you in 1 week 1 week washing still my same rating doesn t make my hair oily or a tangled mess so far love it and how it smells would recommend for anyone who has oily straighter hair 
2013-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i quite like this shampoo on the first wash it did strip my hair a bit but after conditioner my hair was soft shiny and even a little more voluminous after air drying this is more of a clarifying shampoo it s not meant for daily use or you ll end up with hair like hay but using this once a week is great for your hair it clears up all the oil and buildup and gives your hair a little volume it smells great too 
2012-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this is a terribly harsh shampoo i wanted to like it as i prefer to use more natural products when possible but no this was a failure it is super drying to my hair scalp and skin it left my scalp super irritated and with a dry skin issue i don t typically have a manageability problem with my hair but this caused a dry and frizzy mess i have a lot of long fine straight hair not dry nor oily i wash every 2 3 days for what it s worth i don t find this shampoo even cleanses well the texture of the shampoo is a thick gummy gel which was rather unpleasant the scent was kind of fake smoke ish too strong and unpleasant as well 
2012-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this product has now become my regular shampoo it does not foam as much as other shampoos due to the decreased sulphates but even using the tiniest amount my hair still feels cleaner it is gentle and never gives me the stripped feeling that dries and distresses my hair which is fantastic i use it in conjunction with the cherry blosssom and ginseng conditioner and would happily recommend this shampoo to anyone who is seeking a different product bonus it also smells wonderful 
2012-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i really wanted to love this but meh smells good but i seem to always have a bad hair day when i use this won t buy again 
2012-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|aaaah my love amazing shampoo love love love this shampoo i used this sometimes on its own or sometimes do a combo with some random shampoo that i wanna clear up so badly however i found it difficult to get it here is singapore which is sad 
2012-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|no just no this shampoo is horrible for my hair i bought it because i m on a hunt for a good sulfate free shampoo l oreal s everpure shampoo caused a lot of hair fallout so i tried this one after i rinsed the shampoo out i couldn t believe what a poof of tangles my hair was i hoped that the matching conditioner would detangle my hair i had to apply it to my root area which is a big no no for fine hair like mine but my hair was such a tangled mess i needed conditioner from root to tip i wasn t happy about that and thought about what a limp mop my hair would be even worse when i rinsed the conditioner out after leaving it on for a few minutes my hair was still tangly and felt like straw so i applied my trusty nioxin conditioner which completely detangled it but i had to apply it to the roots again for some reason i still had hope for the shampoo thinking if i gave my hair enough time to adjust to it it would begin to work better for two weeks i continued the process of shampooing applying the conditioner root to tip after my hair continued to get extremely tangled from the shampoo then using my nioxin conditioner after the organix one didn t help after no improvements in two weeks i don t know care if it ll ever work i ll hold on to the conditioner cause it might work with a better shampoo as far as my hair turned out afterward when i let it air dry it actually wasn t bad it looked really shiny and silky but with all the conditioner i have to use it s just not worth it after my bad experiences with sulfate free shampoos i might just go back to normal shampoo gave this product two lipped because it smells amazing and since its sulfate free it would be a good alternative to normal shampoos if it works for someone else 
2012-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|favorite shampoo this is the bomb i received a travel size sample set of this shampoo and conditioner and gave it a try this cleanses my scalp quite well so i always use it with the conditioner i don t use this everyday because it can be quite drying and use it during the days i wanna doll up the next day for my hair to be softer and smoother use it with the conditioner to get better results because it really just makes my oily scalp clean and my hair lightweight i also find my hair to air dry a whole lot faster with this shampoo conditioner combo and tangles are a lot lesser too definitely recommend but this is not for daily uses 
2012-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|my hair had a weird reaction to this product it didn t dry out but it kind of felt like it was coated in a waxy product my hair wasn t fly away but it was kind of unruly and uncooperative my hair and i have a daily battle normally i am able to dry curl tease and spray it into submission but after washing with this product my hair was the victor i had to toss a mostly full bottle out and i can say without hesitation that i would never purchase this product again 
2012-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this makes my hair feel so amazing 
2012-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this made my hair very dry even though it claims to be sulfate free it smells wonderful i had such high hopes for this because i love anything cherry blossom i am not sure if i would buy this again maybe to use as shower gel or something the conditioner is very light but also smells wonderful 
2012-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|holy mother of cow this thing made my scalp so itchy i wanted to try an organic shampoo and found this in the shampoo section at walmart at the time i was experiencing slight hair loss and while the ends of my hair were slightly dry i wanted something that wouldn t dry out my hair further unfortunately this wasn t going to help not only did my hair lack improvement but i was left with an awful itching i thought maybe the itching would disappear but it progressively got worse i don t know if i m allergic but it might be something you should look into if you purchase this shampoo also i was used to washing my hair every other day this shampoo doesn t seem like it cleans well enough so the next day i d end up having to wash my hair again one thing i do love is the smell of this shampoo it smells amazing and seems very potent such that i could smell it in my hair even the day after bottle reminds me of l oreal kids which is never a bad thing since i really liked that product as a kid 
2012-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this made my scalp really itchy and the scent is very overwhelming not for me
2012-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|the beauty advisor at walgreen s talked me into buying this i love the way it smells and the packaging is unique but it just doesn t get sudsy enough to really clean my hair i ve also had this problem with jason brand shampoos i ve been trying to wash my hair only every other day to ensure the natural oils stick around and it doesn t dry out at the ends however i feel like i need a more detergent y type of shampoo to do this i need it to be clean for two days not oily and greasy halfway through the first day so as much as i love the idea of organic shampoos i m going to have to switch back to herbal essences 
2012-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|loooooove this shampoo recently started trying organix products and this is the best i ve wasted alot of money on many shampoos lately trying to find one that works for me pantene loreal redken tresemme other organix products just most drugstore shampoos basically this doesn t work miracles but it is the best i ve found it makes my hair feel soft and healthy and smells really fruity and sweet love it so much 
2012-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|if you haven t used natural sls paraben etc free shampoos you may notice you don t get suds like you will with other more conventional shampoos but like others have said your hair gets used to this once the buildup of silicones and what not gets removed first off the smell is heavenly delicious i got this with the conditioner and after air drying my hair is fragrant clean and silky i use a few shampoos depending how curly i want to be and i like this better than jason or the avalon organics line scent wise i find they all compare in the clean department will buy again
2012-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|a nice gentle shampoo that does seem to add volume to my fine hair without irritating my sensitive scalp i wash everday and this neither weighs down or overdrys the shine it gives is superb 
2011-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this is the best shampoo i ve used in my adult life it s the first product that hasn t weighed my hair down since i used kids shampoo this actually cleans my hair of dirt and oils and doesn t have extra product that will cause my hair to become greasy oily and feeling heavy my hair is always in my face so also i don t really have oils on my face anymore my hair feels soft light and clean even after a whole day
2011-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this was the best organix product i ve tried so far my daughter likes it too we both have fine blond hair that can get oily at the scalp my daughter actually requested it a second time which is unusual for her she s 12 and usually doesn t get into beauty stuff i think she likes the smell light and sort of fruity floral it s a way better shampoo than the tea tree mint left my hair clean but not dry or coated the complaint i have about the packaging is that on these shampoos the flip top breaks easily and is kind of hard to open 
2011-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|because i have eczema on my scalp i decided to give organic shampoo a try this product was horrible i would say the only good thing about it was the smell and the fact that is was organic after using it my hair was super tangled when wet to the point where combing it was not even an option its not so bad after it dries though but still a bit tangly the end result is very dry and straw like hair with a bit of frizz i will not be buying this product again it s a shame because it smells wonderful i got many compliments for that 
2011-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this is a pretty good volumizing shampoo it got my oily roots clean left my hair volumized and smells lovely on the downside it did leave my thick coarse long hair crunchy and impossible to comb without adding lots of heavy conditioner and product it would probably work great for someone with different hair but it just wasn t right for me 
2011-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|here in singapore this shampoo is about sgd 15 in my store and the same applies to the conditioner it s really costly but i learned how sulphates can be damaging to your hair it doesn t help that most drugstore shampoos have sulphates in them so i thought i would get it note that this is my second sulphate free shampoo the first one i tried was the burt s bee s raspberry moisture shampoo or something like that it wasn t amazing since my hair only felt soft and manageable when i used the burt s bee s deep conditioning treatment so when i ran out of that i thought i would get this brand what drew me in was the packaging how cute and the smell is absolutely heavenly it smells floral and fruity at the same time the beauty of cherry blossom and it has kind of a vanilla scent to it too when you lather it in however after using the shampoo my hair didn t feel soft don t get me wrong i absolutely love the shampoo and the conditioner together since they make my hair so shiny and healthy looking when used together the conditioner helps to soften my hair a bit so don t get this shampoo without the conditioner the final verdict my hair hasn t felt healthier it s slightly more rough than when i used the burt s bee s shampoo and deep conditioning treatment but this is only after two or three uses i m overall satisfied with this product it makes my hair healthy looking it doesn t make it look damaged it looks shiny and although it isn t exactly soft it s really not rough either would not recommend just getting the shampoo get the conditioner too they smell amazing 
2011-08|1.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|beware to anyone with sensitive skin that is breakout prone i have tried this product and the moroccan argan oil hair masque and both caused a reaction that i ended up going to the doc for i had low to mild grade folliculitis on the sides of my face and jaw for months before i figured out it was triggered by a product i was prescribed antibiotics and oral steroids to clear up the problem but neither made a lasting difference after the problem persisted i made a second doc visit this time he told me i was probably having a reaction to something i was using in my skincare or haircare and to remember what i was using before i started having these problems he gave me a shot for inflammation and prescribed attarax for the irritation i switched to head and shoulders and went back to the giovanni organics conditioner i had used in the past i have not figured out what ingredient or ingredients don t agree with my skin so i am just going to stay away from the whole line 
2011-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i got this after using the moroccan argan oil and the coconut serum i got great results with both the smell is absolutely amazing my hair is oily in the roots but dry at the ends and the shampoo just made this worse after the first couple of days my hair turned into a mess my roots were so oily i had to wash them twice a day and i even had to trim the ends because they were so dry also i got this annoying itch i definitely won t buy again 
2011-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i bought this because it doesn t contain sulfates the cute packaging the pretty scent and the reviews here on makeup alley i love this shampoo i ve used it 3 times so far and it makes my hair super soft and clean without weighing it down i don t even need to use conditioner i m gonna buy this again and recommend it 
2011-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i gave this a week before reviewing it i have fine hair and a sensitive scalp the first time i used it i freaked out at how tangled up my hair was even after using the conditioner but when my hair dried it was so soft i normally wash my hair every day because it greases up so fast but with this i can skip a day as far as volume it doesn t weigh my hair down but it doesn t build volume building volume is where product comes into play i love the smell if you can push through the first couple of uses it is great and i would definitely encourage everyone to give it a try 
2011-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i have colored my hair for years now sometimes with stylists and sometimes on my own when money is tight so finding a good shampoo conditoner is important to me i like to keep my hair in the best shape possible and i am against animal testing and look for sulfrate paraben free products if you do the research you will see that these things are super bad for your hair number one i love the smell of all of the organix line this shampoo lathers up nicely and removes all the dirt and hair spray though i use very little some reviews complained about price yes at many locations the price is insane i found it cheapest at winco for 3 51 for either the shampoo and cond if you have one go there some complained of the tangles it left in thier hair i have very long hair so it is normal for me to have tangles even after a conditioning i use detangler always focus 21 seaplasma is a super one great price under 6 bucks and good for skin as well i also use organix renewing moroccan argan oil i wash and conditon my hair every other day after towel drying i use the right amount of oil and smooth it through my hair while upside down it is a great blowing drying protection that leaves hair smooth and shiny i would not change my routine at all when i do go to the stylist she is amazed at how healthy my hair looks and feels 
2011-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|like that this shampoo is sls free and available at cvs tried this after the renpure organics line and i slightly prefer this shampoo b c of the great scent and it foams better too bad i hate the conditioner and prefer to use matching shampoo and conditioners together so i prob will be trying something else otherwise i would buy again 
2011-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|itchy itchy itchy head was so itchy after using this yes it smells lovely yes bottle is pink and cute yes it is natural but my hair was a lot dryer and tangly than normal i have tried other natural organic shampoos natralia nourish australian organics natural intincts this was by far the least liked and most expensive give natralia a go if you are looking for natural shampoos australian made leaves your hair beautifully soft and bouncy amazing for a natural shampoo and sooo shiny as for organix yes i used up the bottle well my poor husband did but i won t buy their products again 
2011-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|the thing with sulfate free stuff is you have to give it time to adjust to your hair at first when i started using this brand my hair felt dry and tangly and the shampoo seemed to just soak into my hair so i had to use a bunch but after about a week your hair is nourished and healthy and you wont need to use as much and it ll lather great and never tangle and all that jazz you just have to give it time and you ll love it i only condition my hair about once a week and i have hair from hell believe me 
2011-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this smells amazing exactly like someone below said like cherry vanilla goodness my boyfriend thinks it smells like raspberries i just think it smells like heaven in a bottle this shampoo is pretty good overall you have to use a conditioner with it at least if you have dry curly hair like i do it lathers pretty well but some days better than others depending on how much product or what type of product you use on your hair i think this is definitely worth a shot if you re considering it and i d repurchase simply for the scent

2011-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i love organix products i have tried a lot of their shampoo and conditioner combinations and have been impressed with all of them they smell great are sulfate free and are really good for your hair i will definitely buy these shampoos and conditioners for many years to come 
2011-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i really like this shampoo i have super thin hair and this has helped remove alot of build up that accumulates on my scalp it doesn t give me any extra volume but makes my hair feel healthy and clean which is all i really want in a shampoo in my opinion you can t expect much of a shampoo other than to clean your hair shampoo gets washed down the drain styling products is what does the hard work the shampoo smells amazing i could smell this all day i love that it is sulfate and paraben free i notice that my hair stays cleaner looking longer than with other brands because my hair is so thin it looks super greasy just one day after washing but with this stuff it looks decent for 2 3 days after washing which is a big bonus for me

2011-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|ok so i bought this product because of all the reviews that i read here on mua however i was not a big fan of it at all after using it it made my hair soooooo tangled and dry feeling i had to go out and buy a deep conditioner just because of all the damage it did to my hair i have thick curly hair but its very soft so this took away my soft hair and i was not happy about that the only plus side to this shampoo was the scent it smells amazing but i think im going to use this as a shampoo to get rid of all the product build up once a month because thats what i felt it did it stripped everything off my hair haha maybe this would be better for someone with more oily hair

2011-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i heard about this shampoo in a magazine along with great reviews so i thought i would give it a shot i picked it up at walmart target didnt carry it for about 6 00 i only bought the shampoo because i use a certain conditioner for my color treated hair i read the back of the bottle and it says that everything from the labels on it to the ink is environmental and compostable so that sealed the deal i must say you need to use quite a bit of this shampoo in order to get a good enough lather going i even tried adding some water now and then to get the lather going after using the shampoo my hair was really really tangled and i needed to use a lot of conditioner to finally detangle it the smell is great i absolutly love that but the rest isnt so great maby i need to use both the shampoo and conditioner to get the full effect but overall it didnt really work for me i must say im so in love with the scent that i prob will buy it again just for that but all in all there are definetly better shampoos out there for the price i paid 
2011-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i love this shampoo and the conditioner recently i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism with this medical condition you can lose hair and i have lost some of mine since this is a sulfate free shampoo it is good for people who are prone to hair loss to use the smell is wonderful the packaging is cute and functional it gives my hair volume and for some reason makes the color of my hair i dye it blonde lighter and prettier my hair is soft and shiny even though this is a sulfate free shampoo is does lather i recommend this shampoo to everyone i really love it 
2010-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|first of all the smell is divine i love this shampoo conditioner i have very curly hair and personally it makes it curlier and gives it more volume my hair seems healthier just after about a week of use i will definitely be buying from organix again after this runs out i love it so much 
2010-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i do not understand the negative reviews on here my hair has never been softer this also leaves me with a nice shine i am trying to go mostly quot poo quot free so i wanted a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner maybe the people aren t washing their hair throughly enough even going quot poo quot free you still have to wash your hair with your hands and the water to get the dirt out and your hair will be oily for awhile because your hair is trying to compensate so you might get greasy hair but it will even out once you continue the use long enough this has a great smell and an appealing package i love this and will definitely buy again 
2010-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this is a very girlie product with a sweet strawberry scent which comes in a cute pink bottle for an organic shampoo it lathers and rinses well and doesn t irritate my scalp it s more on the clarifying than the conditioning side great for fine short hair that lacks volume overall quite a good organic product at a decent price 
2010-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i love love loved the smell of this the smell last all day even after a workout gave my hair a nice shine but i noticed my forehead breaking out 2 weeks after using it and it never breaks out i stopped using this and it cleared up i wish this could have worked for me hopefully it will work better for you guys 
2010-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|first of all the smell of this is amazing my boyfriend absolutely loves it my hair is naturally wavy straight and a tiny bit oily so i didnt find it drying though i wouldn t recommend using it without the conditioner i do find my hair has less volume when i use this shampoo conditioner combo but it does feel very silky 
2010-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|honestly this product sucks my hair was constantly tangled and dull and my scalp became oily the next day i bought a sample size of another shampoo just to see if the problem was this shampoo and lo and behold my hair became smooth and my scalp less oily right away i m never using this again 
2010-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this is a solid 2 lippie shampoo it didn t make my hair feel particularly volumized or nourished rather sometimes it made my hair so tangled that i was forced to use conditioner when i usually only use conditioner about 2 3 times a week on the less negative side it didn t dry out my hair strip it of it s moisture or add build up i did enjoy the smell and the cute bottle but i ve got lush shampoos to fulfill that first requirement and the cuteness of the bottle doesn t really have much to do with the condition of my hair i did use up my bottle but i won t be buying it again 
2010-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|this does give volume to my fine shoulder length hair but it is drying i have some damaged frizzy ends from home highlighting kits so i ll probably put this shampoo aside until i get some more of the ratty bits cut out 
2010-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|like most other volumizing shampoos this one seems to work by blowing open the hair shaft not the best thing for color treated or dry hair i really love the scent but its way to harsh for hair even with the conditioner my hair feels like straw after dry and coarse 
2010-08|4.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|i ve been using this shampoo for about a month now and it s become one of my favorites it does have a lovely fragrance my hair can be difficult naturally it s very fine and straight so to get some volume and style ability i have it permed and i style it using round metal brushes and a blow dryer pretty drying routine right now the perm s grown out on the top so it s flat again and the back is dry and frizzy the cherry blossom ginseng shampoo and conditioner have done wonders for both problems the conditioner is one of the few i ve ever used that doesn t leave my hair weighed down and flat and the shampoo really is volumizing i ve been getting even better results by putting the conditioner on just the dry areas and rinsing it out before i shampoo the results are so good i won t need to schedule my next perm as soon as i thought i d need to 
2010-08|2.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|saw this product in the local supermarket and was attracted by the cute packaging once i smelt it i was sold initial use was all good however after a month of regular use every second or third day this stuff has killed my hair i ve noticed much more breakage it has stripped the colour and shine from my hair and has left it feeling like straw now i need to go purchase a treatment to fix my hair will never repurchase or try other organix products again

2010-08|3.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo|well i bought this because it was organic sulfate free the good stuff right but it didnt work so well on me i wanted a safe organic shampoo conditioner my scalp is very picky it sometimes gets pumps pimples and i break out along my hair line with regular shampoo so i decided to try this brand for the first time overall i didnt like it and wouldnt buy it again pro good price cute packaging smells great doesnt break me out cons it makes my scalp itch my hair is staticky no noticable volume any my hair feels dry

2015-08|5.0|Luxurious Moroccan Argan Creme Sheer Hydration Leave-in Mist|this has been a life saver for me i have fine dry and naturally wavy hair i use this on damp hair and dry it seems to tame my fly away and make my hair shinier now that i have bought this bottle i m already looking for my second i can t find it anywhere is it possible that others have caught on to this hidden gem 
2014-08|4.0|Luxurious Moroccan Argan Creme Sheer Hydration Leave-in Mist|this was a pleasant surprise i bought it at ulta during their bogo 50 sale it has a musky oriental like scent that fades throughout the day and it has a oily cream texture i use about two to three sprays for my hair avoiding my roots since that area gets oily already it is slightly heavy so those with finer hair may want to use less or avoid it but it controls flyaways and frizzy ends very well i like that this contains castor oil as well it does provide adequate shine and it leaves my hair feeling soft overall it is pretty good for a spray leave in 
2014-08|5.0|Luxurious Moroccan Argan Creme Sheer Hydration Leave-in Mist|as the front of the product states it is a quot leave in spray lotion quot and i would say it is similar to the consistency of it s a 10 it makes my hair really soft and shiny like any other leave in product i concentrate this on the middle and ends of my hair since my hair tends to get oily towards the end of the day it has a very pleasant smell reminiscent of a men s cologne possibly jpg le male in my opinion this lovely scent does not last throughout the day like it s a 10 tends to do but that s fine to me i am glad i decided to try this because it is a way less expensive alternative to it s a 10 and i reap the same benefits from this product i purchased a 6 oz bottle for about 6 also i like that the product comes in a spray bottle as opposed to a pump i also reviewed organix coconut milk leave in nourishing milk and while both products serve similar purposes and work great i prefer this moroccan argan creme mist 
2013-08|4.0|Luxurious Moroccan Argan Creme Sheer Hydration Leave-in Mist|edited 27 dec 2015 i saw this in a magazine and the benefits said to hydrate hair and leave it moisturized i thought it would be a light mist but it actually is more of a creme with an oily texture when i applied it to my hair and combed it through it instantly made it smooth and silky it might take a bit of the creme to tame fly aways but i am very happy with this product but it doesn t tame all fly aways the smell might take some getting used to but i do like it 
2015-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i didn t really care for this conditioner it didn t do much for my hair my hair is really thick long and wavy this conditioner didn t moisturize much and my hair felt so dry to the point where it felt scratchy to make it worst i m convinced that this conditioner is breaking me out i have bumps on my scalp and on my forehead along the hairline at first i thought well maybe i wasn t rinsing it out enough but nope every time i used this i broke out in really bad acne i bought this on sale silly me i got four bottles of this stuff will be giving it to my sister who has really fine hair might work for her 
2015-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i am disappointed with both the organix argan oil shampoo and conditioner the conditioner does not seem to do much it does not detangle or add mosture yet leaves my hair feeling limp and coated with a film 
2014-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|wow i am absolutely in love with this stuff i am especially pleased because i decided to pick this up in a hurry one day at cvs because i was afraid i was going to run out of conditioner before my box of harvey prince hair stuff arrived it was a bogo sale and i decided to try this with the oil treatment which i haven t opened yet but i have finished the bottle of this and will definitely be repurchasing i tend to purchase very moisturizing conditioners because i have very long hair that i often heat style but i also have very greasy hair with a lot of product buildup from all the leave in stuff i add therefore the moisturizing conditioners i often lean toward sometimes backfire and end up adding a lot of weight and even more buildup to my hair nexxus especially this conditioner added a nice silky yet lightweight feel to my hair on top of holding in the moisture and smelling great i wish the bottles packaging was a little larger with organix products in general which is my only real complaint this product is up there on my hg list of conditioners fekkai prx reparatives and bedhead styleshots extreme straight i am both humbled and very excited to have found a drug store conditioner that is not only inexpensive but up to snuff with the fancy ones 
2014-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|to be frank and direct this conditioner didn t meet my hair s standards for me i like my conditioners to moisturising and this did not do well even with an adequate amount of conditioner it wasn t enough to soften my hair throughout two days on the first day my hair felt soft manageable and silky i was able to run my hair through it without any tangles however on my second day i don t know why but immediately it starts feeling rough tangled and a bit dry magically on the second day it just seems like my hair wants to stop having a soft silky structure but rather transform into a tress that is simply unmanageable i have fine straight hair the conditioner is not moisturising one quarter through the product i found it didn t give enough softness to endure for two days i will continue to finish this product but i add another conditioner for more silkiness and smoothness it s simply not enough to continue the softness and only after one day with hair down or up it was just not satisfying the price for this product in australia is pretty expensive from 7 99 in us to around 17 95 in australia for just the one for this i wouldn t be repurchasing my only positive point is that it does gives you the shine i always wash out the conditioner with cold water but i used warm hot water because the weather was freezing one time and it still gave me the same result super shiny everytime you move the shine moves with you i guess the packaging appeals to people it appealed to me 
2014-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i like this conditioner as far as organix goes this isn t my favorite of their conditioners the brazilian keratin is the best 
2014-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this conditioner is currently sitting in a trash bag waiting to be taken out later today quite possibly the worst conditioner i ve purchased in awhile bottle design is awful you need to squeeze hard to get any product out even with a full bottle texture was ok so so easy to spread but after i d rinsed a few times it still felt as though there as a massive film coating my hair i didn t apply this anywhere but on the ends of my hair and by the end of the same day my hair was greasy heavy and generally just really awful will never purchase again and strongly recommend you look elsewhere for sulfate free options 
2014-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|the reviews for this product seem all over the place but as someone pointed out everyone s unique hair chemistry will yield a different result my hair is dry damaged amp thin from highlighting very light blonde the super hard water at our house doesn t help matters either even with a water filter i look for a conditioner that will serve either as a quot daily quot conditioning product not too heavy gives good slip or as a quot weekly quot conditioning product corrects damage this really didn t fall into either boat the formula is very thick and my hair seemed to drink it up i noticed a slight oil kind of fragrance but nothing strong i rinsed the product out after less than 5 minutes because i was concerned that it might actually be too heavy i don t shampoo condition daily so i don t want to start out with greasy hair the conditioner rinsed clean but wow did i have the tangles even after using my usual detangler heat protector spray i think i actually lost more hairs than usual very bad my hair seemed more difficult to dry than normal frequently tangling once done it had a nice sheen but did not look or feel anything special i would not repurchase because i don t see this fitting in with either my regular routine or my deep conditioning routine and i definitely cannot afford extra hair loss i have had a bad time with their products before i e coconut milk amp i guess this one is just as sub par for my needs 
2014-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this stuff is amazing i was actually surprised to see that it had such a low rating but of course everyone s hair responds differently for me this is one of the best conditioners i ve ever tried and definitely the best drugstore conditioner i ve ever used my hair feels smooth as butter when i wash this stuff out and it s so easy to comb out my hair afterwards after i blow dry my hair i can t stop touching it because it s so soft and silky i will definitely be repurchasing once i run out of this stuff 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|in my opinion this is for thick curly or wavy hair not for thin hair which can probably make your hair too greasy i have very thick curly prone to frizz hair and i use this when i blow dry my hair the shampoo combined with the conditioner has made my hair smooth and shiny 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i have virgin hair but it is dry and has split ends sadly that is probably due to my sensitive scalp i got this as i hoped it would help condition my hair better than the macadamia oil conditioner from the same brand first it smells great like a product you would find in a salon very professional and expensive like there is a oil scent to it it smells rich and a little nutty i think a good reference is the moroccan argan creme spray it smells pretty similar to this but this one is much better after washing it out after 4 minutes my hair feels smooth and silky it also smells awesome i think this is a good conditioner but i will want to try other conditioners and if nothing beats this i will come back to it 
2013-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i switch conditioners constantly but tried this a couple of times it leave my dry wavy hair feeling even drier it is hard to comb through and blow dry too waist of money and their bottles are always hard to use 
2013-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i paired this with the shampoo and i ve written a more lengthy review on that but overall the only thing i like about it is the smell both products made my hair too greasy 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|love this conditioner i have very dry curly hair that i regularly colour and straighten with heat i used to stay away from drug store brands because i found they did nothing for my dry and over worked hair but this comes a close second to the pricy salon brands i have been using over the years and for half the price i can see how this product may be too heavy for those who have fine hair its more suited for those with dry thicker hair 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this conditioner s performance was average on my coarse wiry hair type the bottle design is impractical you need two hands to squeeze product out and the bottle width makes it hard to hold and manage also you can t stand the bottle upside down to get remaining product out 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i bought this because i prefer non sulphate products after trying no poo for a couple of years i find it pretty decent for frequent use my hair feels soft and smells pleasant it does not have much slip though for people who like to comb their hair when conditioning the bottle though cute is a bit hard to squeeze 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i like this conditioner a lot i ve been using it for a little over a year now i don t use it all the time i interchange with the mask version and the generic moisture paul mitchell formula from sally s the only downside to this is that i have long hair so i have to use about a quarter size for it to actually make my hair soft but i love the smell and how it makes my hair feel
2013-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i should have known i bought the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner from this line and hated it thought this might be better but no i want my conditioner to have some slip and make my hair feel well conditioned this feels so terrible and it feels like my hair is more tangled after i rinse this out never touching this line again 
2013-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this product was totally not worth the money i just then washed my hair with it and ive spent 15 minutes trying to get all of the knots out of my hair i must have had about 5 birdnest knots in my hair is so frustrating to detangle you just got rid of a knot and if you brush your hair in a different direction bam the knot is back omg it made me so cranky worst shampoo and conditioner ive used and its the whole organix brand not just this type ive tried them all gt 
2013-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i got travel sizes of this shampoo and conditioner i ve been using the dry oils from organix the macadamia nut and the awapui with great results so i was curious about trying the shampoo and conditioner with argan oil the conditioner was very heavy a thick jelly like cream that is rather hard to spread evenly through your hair my hair felt dry and heavy immediately upon application afterwards when i d washed it out my hair was shiny but very static y and dry looking i am throwing this out not worth it 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|as conditioners go this was alright used in conjunction with the shampoo this did an ok job of conditioning my hair although i found if i put too much in it did have the tendency to leave my hair feeling a little weighed down and harder to style afterwards given that moroccan argan oil seems to be the thing at the moment i guess i was expecting a lot more from this than it actually delivered there was nothing really offensive about it but i don t think it did anything amazing for or to my hair so for that reason i probably wouldn t buy it again 
2013-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i bought the shampoo for this a while ago so thought i would try the conditioner to match i have dry hair and usually use aussie take the heat conditioner i don t heat style much but like the protection i have to say this organix conditioner is awful on my hair even using a very generous amount when it goes on my hair it feels like it does nothing when it washes out of my hair it feels the same it somehow seems to make my hair drier and i can barely comb it once out the shower i have to spray on a separate leave in conditioner so for me this doesn t do the job at all especially for something that s almost a tenner a pop will be going back to aussie a 50p sized blob of that and i can feel it condition my hair straight away 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i do like alternating with this to leave my hair moisturised however i do find the packaging hard to squeeze from and it is a little expensive for what it does i doubt that it would restore overly damaged hair but for hair that s a little dry this is nice 
2013-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this made my back and neck break out horribly and my hair felt like straw definitely no good for me
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|now this is a great conditioner i have dyed and bleached and all kinds of tortured hair and this conditioner leaves it feeling as if i had never put a flat iron to it my hair feels soft and healty especially on the ends where i d gotten it done and ombre look this paired with the shampoo is a great systerm 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this stuff smells devine i really wanted to purchase the keratin conditioner in this brand but the smell was off putting this conditioner is pretty light weight i would definitely recommend it to people who have thin and or short hair i don t feel like it gives enough moisture for people who have color treated hair i do not or people who use tons of heat to style their hair i do like that it doesn t leave any sort of buildup or cause your hair to be weighed down overall it s not exactly what i m looking for but it might be a decent product for someone else and i wouldn t discourage anyone from trying it 
2013-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this conditioner is a little bit more expensive than what i d normally pay for say tresseme or garnier i got this on sale as i didn t quite want to pay full price for something i didn t like when i got the sample this made my hair feel like silk but since using the full bottles for almost a month now plus dying it as well it doesn t seem to really moisturize or leave it silky at all even when i leave it in for 5 6 minutes it s soft in the shower but then it becomes super dry i have really curly hair mind you so any bit of frizz shows up really easy this isn t worth it for me i d rather go with a cheaper brand that actually does what it says 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i am not sure if i m reviewing the correct conditioner the one i purchased was sort of a chesnut brown color but it smells divine and it was a larger size on sale at wal mart i get my hair bleached and it s processed and blah blah blah my hair stylist told me not to use any hair products on my hair like tresemme herbal essences etc my hair was super fragile when i first got it to platinum i couldn t even straighten my hair or use heat on it because i was letting it regain it s strength back i also use an expensive moroccan deep restorative mask for hair lol and it smells absolutely delicious and i figured why not stay within the same theme well it turns out that this is amazing my hair is super soft and stronger it smells like heaven and i ve never seen it so silky and smooth before it totally restored my stressed out hair back to normal and i m convinced it s even more healthy then before i went platinum 
2013-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|the way i feel about this conditioner is exactly the same as the review i wrote about the shampoo don t waste your money made my hair look and feel like straw 
2013-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this is my all time holy grail of conditioners someone gave me the little travel bottle of the stuff because they didn t want it so i thought i would just try it out when i had finished drying my hair i could not believe how soft it was it was unlike anything i had ever experienced hair wise i immediately went out and bought the shampoo and conditioner my hair is now so soft and shiny looking all my friends have been asking what i have been doing differently to my hair this conditioner is pure gold in a bottle 
2013-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i m actually quite shocked to see the amount of low reviews for this conditioner my hair has been getting drier over the past couple of winter months and i needed something to help quickly i dye my hair every two months lighter use a flat iron once or twice a week and only need to wash my hair about every 3 4 days i immediately noticed how much softer my hair was as it dried i didn t even need to use my flat iron afterwards and i have fairly thick hair it feels like i just went to my stylist the product recommends that you use it with organix shampoos so maybe that s why others aren t having the same luck with it i used the hydrating macadamia oil shampoo right before usually i have the worst luck with brands so i ve been quite pleased with this one it s a keeper 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this is my favorite conditioner i have used other organix products in the past and wasn t too impressed the coconut oil conditioner and tea tree oil conditioner both made my hair incredibly hard to manage brush the moroccan argan oil conditioner is like butter on your hair it smells amazing too i put a decent amount on my hair let it sit for 3 4 minutes then rinse it has made my hair much softer since i started using it and it s a great deal considering it has no parabens sulfates etc definitely organix s best product 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|conditioner did nothing for my hair i started with the matching shampoo which dried out my hair i followed with the conditioner and couldn t untangled my hair i had to follow up with pureology hydralight conditioner just so i can get my wide tooth comb through my hair will not repurchase 
2012-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i really enjoyed the fragrance of the mao shampoo and conditioner and found that the conditioner really detangled and soothed my hair it also gave my hair body and definition and defrizzed it it s definitely not as moisturizing as other conditioners but maybe that s what i like about it 
2012-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i wish i could love this the bottle is so cute and the smell is so good that said my hair just does not look great using this it lacked volume when i used this and i didn t get great shine either its not the worst conditioner i have ever used but far from the best and i also went through it really fast i do recommend their body lotion though if you like the fragrance it works much better in my opinion than their hair products 
2012-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|when you read through the description and the overall packaging it is very appealing at a glance hence i ended up buying it and now stuck using it to till it s consumed it is not worth it at all it does nothing for my hair though it smells nice 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i had heard so many good things about argan oil that i was excited to try this conditioner my hair is very fine colored damaged and dry at the ends this conditioner did nothing at all didn t even leave my hair feeling like i had used conditioner it smelled pleasant enough but since it didn t actually do anything i won t be buying again like another reviewer has said argan oil is very low on the list of ingredients so it looks like organix are just jumping on the argan oil bandwagon without actually thinking this product through waste of money 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|horrible if you have natural african american hair i gave it one lippie because it worked ok on my weave and it smelled nice but other then that don t waste the money 
2012-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|honestly so disgusting my aunt gave this to me and i absolutely hate it i have almost pure argan oil from pyt and it is amazing so using this was so gross its really thick and honestly provided nothing for my hair argan oil is one of the last things on the list meaning there s barely any actual argan oil in it honestly save your money up for actual moroccan argan oil 
2012-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i gave this a try a few times as an alternative to live clean s line of argan oil s amp c these were the only brands of argan oil products at the drugstore i think live clean is far superior the organix conditioner leaves my hair very tangled my hair blow dries nicely and my hair looks nice soft and shiney much better than sillicone conditioners but i don t like having to detangle so much no other product causes so many tangles for me as this one 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|pros conditions hair smell good paraben free cheap easy to find cons none overall i love this conditioner i have very healthy hair and i don t know if its the shampoo conditioner or both but after i wash my hair it feel sooooo soft and looks even more shiny than it usually is i just can stop feeling it i love how it smells too and it was cheap and easy to find i love that it is paraben free too i don t know how people don t love this conditioner i can t wait to try the rest of the shampoo and conditioners in this brand 
2012-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|didn t like this conditioner at all i have very thick curly hair so i thought i would give it a try since i use argan oil in my hair it did nothing to make my hair feel more hydrated i have had much better results with cheaper products like garnier and aussie i would not buy it again 
2012-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i suffer from dry and very easily tangled hair as my individual strands of hair are very fine but i have lots of it my hairdresser suggested i try some products with argan oil in them to try and naturally bring moisture back to my hair i found this organix range really helped my hair bring back its moisture and made it 100 more manageable i use the shampoo and conditioner plus with miracle moist aussie conditioner which makes the organix one last 10 times longer if your hair is really dry and hard to manage use one of there hair serums on wet hair and then comb through they give your hair that extra boost of moisture and shine 
2012-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this conditioner just doesn t compare well to the other argan products on the market it wasn t as hydrating as i expected i recommend one n only argan oil moisture repair conditioner instead 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|so let me begin by saying i thought this product was a complete flop but then i figured out a different way of using it with my regular pantene conditioner i would just rinse out all of it in the shower i did the same when i first purchased this conditioner and it was horrible like i had no conditioner in my hair so i worked out a way to use this with amazing results i don t completely rinse out this conditioner and when i m done toweling my hair still mostly wet damp i put a pea sized amount in through my hair like a serum omg i was floored i didn t want to waste this entire bottle so through experimentation i ve made this conditioner my hg even i would have problems with this conditioner if i had to rinse it all out i just don t think that this is a full rinse conditioner try this technique if your having problems you have nothing to lose 
2012-08|4.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i dyed my hair blonde a while ago which left my hair feeling quite dry this conditioner is better than any other sulfate free products i ve tried e g boots naked range and just as good as any other moisturising ones i use this every day and my hair feels just a soft maybe softer than before dyeing the only drawback is the smell too sweet sigh nothing smells as good as the john frieda brilliant brunette conditioner 
2012-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|let me just say the whole organix line is probably the best smelling drugstore shampoos and conditioners you can buy the performance however is a totally different story i have tried the coconut shampoo and conditioner in the past and it was not a good experience you d think i would have learned my lesson then i decided to give the moroccan argan oil line a try anyway once again just as the coconut conditioner did it didn t moisturize or detangle my hair at all my hair felt stiff and sort of crunchy when i got out the shower it took me forever and a day to comb the tangles out of my hair it also stripped my hair pretty bad i so wanted to like this stuff because it smells so good but it s so horrible for my hair makes me kinda sad actually lol anyway i give it 2 lippies for the great scent 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this was horrible its so thick that its almost impossible to get out of the bottle my hair is about half way down my back and i used a nickle sized drop just to put on my ends and it made my hair feel weighed down and greasy it smells good but that s about it i would never buy this again and i plan on going and returning the remaining product today 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|my hair is waist length thick and naturally spirally curly i grow it out every 4 years and donate to locks of love so i use only the best but affordable products i only wash twice a week using minimal shampoo however conditioner must be top notch and control these curls i had read that argan oil is a great conditioner for thick curly hair so i gave this a shot i love the smell and if you get lucky you can find the 50 free bottle huge lasts a long time the texture of the conditioner is very thick almost like a lotion i use quite a bit twice a week and leave it in for at least 5 minutes in the shower rinse out with cold water and braid the locks no leave in conditioners they make my hair into the amazon it makes my hair super shiny the curls are very controlled no tangling or knots and the spirals fall beautifully my hair feels very strong and healthy the scent of the conditioner is also very pleasing for the price and the awesome ingredients i am addicted to this stuff it is all i need in a conditioner 
2012-08|3.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i bought this at costco there have a set there which includes the shampoo and penetrating oil this is pretty average it doesn t detangle your hair when your in the shower i like when i can run my fingers through my hair with conditioner in it that way i feel like its going to make my hair soft this doesn t really do it its not bad either it kinda makes my hair thicker for some reason its really average tho theres no wow factor here and its just a marginal conditioner i m done with organix and i m done with quot argan oil quot i m not going to fall for the hype anymore 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i love this conditioner i use it in conjunction with the shampoo and the two have transformed my hair this makes it so shiny and glossy before using these products i had to wash my hair every other day without fail now i can go a maximum of four days if i have to my hair used to take all day to dry it s down to my waist and with this it dries in only four hours i would like to point out that after squeezing the excess water out of your hair do not try and brush comb your hair give it about 45 minutes and a lot of the tangles will fall out by themselves making it much easier to get a wide toothed comb through your hair you do need to leave the conditioner in for three minutes to get the best result and do not apply it to your scalp it will weigh your hair down and give a greasy appearance i have also noticed that other users have stated that their hair feels really weird after using it this is because you haven t washed it out properly and yes i am speaking from personal experience give your hair a really good rinse and squeeze the hair out onto the palm of your hand if the water looks even a little bit milky keep rinsing 
2012-08|2.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|doesn t generate oily scalp but also doesn t really condition my hair it s not drier but it is frizzier not sure how that works but there you go the smell is pretty neutral one of those products that really doesn t do anything other than add an extra step and make me think i am doing something productive in the shower 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|awful i bought this because i love argan oil will never be tryinthis again you have to use so much every time just to get it evenly throughout your hair i have hair about 4 inches past my shoulders and even afterwards it doesn t hydrate at all and it made my fine hair soooo tangley it also smells like a guy s cologne and made my hair smell like it 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|pretty container smells lovely performs terribly it s as if i didn t even use conditioner in my hair made my long fine hair tangle something awful and didn t hydrate at all my hair is dark but it s bleached blonde so i use the kerastase line of products as my staple since it s painfully expensive i m always on the lookout for cheaper ones that perform fairly well just to relieve my budget every now and then i had high hopes for this one but it s definitely not up to par i can understand if this was touted for strengthening properties and chocked full of keratin or something which would mean that it wasn t a necessarily hydrating conditioner but this has none of that aside from being a conditioner which by definition should hydrate and smooth the hair it s a moroccan oil blend yet it dries my hair so disappointing money down the drain 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i really wanted to like this conditioner it s decently priced and easily found however this conditioner did not do the job at all the bottle claims quot a precious blend of moroccan argan oil which instantly penetrates the hair shaft while creating soft seductive silky perfection quot sounds nice right now i usually comb out my hair with a wide tooth comb when my hair is coated in conditioner this conditioner did not detangle at all i had to use way too much to get it done and by that time i had combed out a fair amount of hair it has that generic cheap conditioner fragrance the ingredients aren t really natural at all nor even organic as they re name organix suggests the argan oil is pretty fair down on the ingredient list that should have been the first red flag did not leave my hair moisturized to get an idea of how much product i had to use to even get it to work to comb through my hair i have used half a 386 ml bottle in a week i will never ever buy this again and although this is my first time trying this organix brand i doubt i will ever buy anything else from them either i m going to use this up just because i hate wasting money and it won t take long either considering the amount needed 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|no no no the product is really hard to get out after a couple uses and my hair felt no moisture what so ever i would not recommend this to anyone unless you want a conditioner to not do anything to your hair i got it on sale for 4 99 original was 9 99 at shoppers drug mart and now know why 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|okay so i bought a trial size conditioner from ulta just to try it out and my hair stylist told me that it worked well for my hair so i will be buying again and i want to also try out their other conditioners to mix with my nioxin therapy treatment conditioner 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|no no no
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this was not a good conditioner at all usually when i use a mositrueing shampoo it makes my hair shiny this made it so dry i was so disappointed since i though this would make it nice and shinny and soft its a pretty bad product i would recommened dont use it since it seems like i have more slpit ends after using it also i have super thick black curly hair and it is indian hair so it did not help what so ever 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|i have thick dry color treated hair it took me a couple of weeks to get used to this shampoo and the matching condish i agree the shampoo leaves my hair a bit tangled and acts like a clarifying shampoo i thought it was going to be too drying but i was wrong my hair comes out super shiny and manageable after i blow dry and flat iron i seem to use a lot of this even though my hair is short i try and stock up when ulta has a buy one get one 50 off it s a great value 
2012-08|5.0|Moroccan Argan Oil|this is essential if you are using the coordinating shampoo does not leave my hair flat and i can use it everyday without build up i normally use sprayon leave in conditioners for that reason but this conditioner leaves my hair soft shiny and full of body 
2015-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|i colored and ironed my hair a lot this year and really fried it so much that i could feel my ends start to crunch when i brushed them this mask is inexpensive and has a nice clean creamy smell so i ve been incorporating it into my routine the trick to using this mask is to apply it before washing your hair once a week i leave this on for about 5 10 minutes then wash and condition normally by the time i m rinsing my conditioner out i can feel the difference but more importantly there is no more crunching and my ends definitely look stronger and healthy 
2015-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|this is my hg hair mask i have used the macadamia deep repair masque which i loved and i would buy it again but the organix macadamia oil intensive moisture mask is amazing for the price i have super tight 3c curls and this does amazing things 
2015-08|3.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|this does the job smells okay but gives a silicone y slippery feeling afterwards this isn t actually overly good for your hair this product is moisturising i guess i left mine on overnight and it was very manageable and soft in the morning but honestly it functions better as a conditioner there are better ones out there 
2014-08|1.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|definite disappointment with this product one of the worst hair masks i have ever used wouldn t even call this a mask at most a quot conditioner quot made my hair feel basic and decent after use i even tried using the product on dry hair damp hair wet hair etc doesnt work just don t buy the end 
2013-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|i have 4a 4b hair and have used this for a few months when i deep condition with it overnight i get the best results which are good slip and great curl definition the packaging is ridiculous for the shower and unless there s a sale on it may not be worth the price unless it s walmart or target but i must admit i am addicted to the stuff 
2013-08|2.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|this is the worst least effective hair mask i ve tried i ve even tried leaving it on for 30 minutes covered with shower cap then covered in warm towel leaves my hair feeling like i had not conditioned it at all had a feeling of straw and had so many tangles and knots i found it strange won t buy again still on the search for a good moisturizing hair mask may try a l oreal brand 
2013-08|1.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|i really dislike this product i have fine curly frizzy hair that can get really dry at times this is the second mask treatment i ve bought from this brand and i would never buy this again it is horrible does absolutely nothing for my hair and leaves it tangled and feeling unconditioned it is also not shower friendly because it is in a screw top jar which is super hard to manage in the shower and hard to get the correct amount the first time the only upside i could find with this product is that it smells nice but that is definitely not enough to make me repurchase do yourself a favor and skip this mask 
2013-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|this comes in a jar which makes it difficult for me to use in the shower but it works well on my hair while it is not the most moisturizing deep treatment i have used it does give my hair definition and softens without leaving my hair too frizzy it has the consistency of pudding and is yellow in color i have used the original macadamia mask and that one is much better than the organix for moisturizing abilities but the organix version is better suited for those with fine medium hair textures and will provide more volume it does have a protein in it so if you are protein sensitive than skip this one if you like organix products in general this one is nice to use and it has a decent smell i allow it to sit in my hair while in the shower for 3 5 minutes and then i rinse it out it leaves no residue and my hair doesn t look dull once it air dries i think i paid less than 8 dollars for mine at cvs though i would wait for when it comes on sale 
2013-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|okay i recently brought this product this past monday and i tried it so this is review is based on my first impression i have the macadamia oil shampoo so after i used the shampoo i decided to not use the conditioner since i was going to use the mask so after applying it i left it in my hair for the 3 5 minutes but i decided to leave it in longer and wash it out last minute after i rinsed it out and towel drying my hair already i felt a difference my hair feels softer and my split ends are not noticeable next time i do the mask again i will try and use cold water as oppose to luke warm see if it makes a difference 
2013-08|4.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|this product gives you about ten uses and is a good price for a product that works quite well 
2013-08|1.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|i love organix brand it has never dissapointed me but this time they did this hair mask its the worst thing i have ever put on my hair it left it like if i went to the beach and never washed my hair it was horribly hard and strawlike i will never buy this mask again 
2013-08|3.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|i originally went into rite aid today looking for the macadamia nut oil mask in the green jar that retails for around 30 while searching i found this product i have never used the organix brand but i have friends who have liked these products once i saw the great price 9 00 i opted to try this instead of the one i had originally intended to buy i showered washed my hair with redken all soft shampoo and then put a size able glob of the organix mask onto my towel dried hair i left the product in for over two hours then rinsed and towel dried i am not certain if this mask does any better of a job than using a thick conditioner as a treatment for the same amount of time my hair feels soft but my hair feels the exact same after using my redken conditioner this product does smell incredible and i think it would make a great conditioner as a mask i do think it could be more moisturizing i have fairly thick color treated ash blonde hair that tends to dry straight i thought i should include this into my review as everyone s hair tends to respond to treatments differently 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Oil Intensive Moisture Mask|finally a mask that made my hair shiny and healthy looking most masks all the do is coat my hair with tons of silicones petrolatum mineral oil etc this one doesn t feel or is super moisturizing while applying it but the effects are awesome my hair looks and feel rich and luxurious i only did the 5 minute application next time will do the recommended 20 minutes with heat great product i am beyond happy and impressed with the results 
2015-08|2.0|hydrating macadamia penetrating oil|i highly dislike this stuff it didn t do anything but just make my hair oily even when applied to damp hair and the smallest amount i bought it hoping i d love it cuz it s such a cute package amp it just looks so attractive but sadly organix is seeming to just disappoint me no matter how badly i wanna love them sigh btw the bottle says you can put it on dry hair for split ends and flyaways but it made it ssoooo greasy and oily even when i massage it in to my hair and brush it i won t buy this again i ll stick to coconut oil amp 128587 
2014-08|4.0|hydrating macadamia penetrating oil|i received this item by mistake when i tried to order the dry styling oil i figured that i didn t need another thick oil because i already had the renewing moroccan argan penetrating oil and it was woking well however this turned out to be pleasant mistake i actually prefer it over the argan oil hands down i thought they would be the same aside from sent i couldn t have been more wrong the argan oil is thick and heavy like olive oil it would leave my hands greasy after applying it to my hair and it was easy to use too much and end up with oily hair but it did help so i continued using it but with the macadamia oil it is a little thinner in consistency and after i rub it into my hair what s left on my hands seems to soak in not leaving me scrambling for the nearest thing to wipe my hand on i can even use it on my ends when my hair is dry without risking it making my hair feel dirty or sticky my only complaints are definitely with the bottle it would work so much better with a pump for two reasons 1 it s near impossible to get the same needed amount every time when you have to pour it and 2 it s hard to hold the bottle if you ve already applied the oil to your hair once because it can easily become slippery from the slightest oil still left on your hands i would hate to spill such a good product due to a less than fantastic bottle design 
2015-08|3.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil| this serum was waaaay better than the coconut milk serum this one is thinner and smelled better and did a little more for my hair i have dry hair and i used this back before i knew anything about hair this served as a de frizzer for me and it worked well for that it made my hair shiny and soft but it wasn t as beneficial in the long run for my hair that s what silicones the big component in this product do they make your hair look good in the now but as soon as you wash it out it is in the same state as before after i learned more about hair i only used this for heat styling then i was introduced to paul mitchell super skinny serum which worked better for me during the heat styling occasions so i gave this product away now i just use pure almond oil argan oil or coconut oil on the ends of my hair and they do the same thing this serum did but they are beneficial to my hair in the long run as they improve moisture retention 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i ve been using this for maybe 6 months now and really like it i have semi coarse straight asian hair that can get dried out on the ends about chin length w layers i use a dime sized amount probably a bit less rub between my hands then apply mostly to the ends whatever s left over gets lightly run through damp ish hair and very gently patted on the top near my part to calm any flyaways i then let it air dry w o no problems or greasy look if i remember or feel like making an effort i run a brush through after it dries maybe sure it d probably help my hair look even more shiny and amazing if i used it before blow drying but i hate blow drying the best part of this stuff it s a drugstore product so it s affordable and it smells like kissing potion you know that lip gloss that came in a rollerball applicator the only drawback the packaging wish it came in a dropper bottle or squeeze bottle or something similarly easy to control the top is just a hole w a flip cap so sometimes you get more than you want and it spills and spreads out the top also if it was packaged differently there wouldn t be a need for the extraneous box that it comes on i d rather it be quot free standing quot and sealed or something 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i love this product im on my third bottle now this is truly amazing and made my once dry and dull hair lively and moisturised again and its not like other serums ive tried eg keratse which made it all tangly the next day i love it even though it retails expensive in australia 25 
2013-08|4.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i thought this was a really good nice smelling oil in which you can leave in your hair and can be used on dry hair which is really good it left my hair feeling soft and easier to manage as i have bleach on the ends of my due to dip dying it doesn t leave your hair feeling to oily or sticky as it s quite a light oil the only downside to it is when you leave the bottle on it s side it starts to leak a bit other then that good value for what you get the packaging wasn t any thing fancy but everything else was worth the price 
2013-08|4.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i really love the smell of this product a bit nutty i apply this on my hair to prevent frizz and to bring a nice finish to my hair it does not leaves any residues to my hair they are soft and shinny love it 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|this product is amazing for curly thick haired girls who want a product that moisturizes as well as defrizzes this is it i can definitely see a difference regarding the definition of my curls and the decresased frizziness when i don t use this product it s fairly inexpensive is widely available and smells great the packaging is kind of difficult since it doesn t have a pump so it s kind of difficult to pour too much into your hand but since i have really thick hair too much of this oil is a non issue 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|this is a great lightweight and great smelling oil i have very dry hair but most oils weight down my hair and make it oily but this oil is lightweight but moisturizing enough to give me the effect i want i only wish that it was in a pump for a less messy application 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|this is my first review i had to do it i have baby fine hair so i am careful what i use but i also color my hair over the last several months my hair has become extremely dry my stylist told me i needed moisture since i had done a protein treatment i have tried several masks and protein treatments including enjoy aphogee and it s a 10 they worked but only for the day they next day my hair was dry again i read reviews on this and the shampoo conditioner and decided to give this a try wow i can t say enought good things about this oil it has revitalized my hair and doesn t feel greasy or weigh it down i use it before and after styling and my hair now feels softer than ever even the next day 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i had basically sworn off hair products because they were just gunking up my hair but when i moved to chicago i needed to do something for the humidity this is perfect this is advertised as a dry oil but in reality the macadamia nut oil is the 4th ingredient behind 3 silicones the feel this a silicone serum with a slightly oily finish that evaporates very quickly in my hair leaving no greasy residue once applied my hair dries naturally quickly and it is light fluffy in the good way and very shiny i love that the bottle is small it s still a good value because it takes very little to make this work for your hair i would buy again cheerfully 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i used to believe that most drugstore products were inferior but i have been very pleasantly surprised by several of them including this one this is amazing i have bought approximately ten bottles and use it every single time i wash my hair and will continue to do so this is what i wanted the 25 alterna bamboo kendi oil to be but was completely disappointed with that product the organix macadamia dry oil retails for approximately 7 99 and can be found at any drugstore i use it on towel dried hair and usually air dry but always flatiron when it s completely dry i have dry slightly wavy fine to medium hair texture that will get weighed down by heavy products this looks and feels like an oil but i use about a quarter size and it makes my hair smoother softer and super shiny it does not weigh my hair down at all and in fact i sometime put a teeny bit extra on dry hair before i flatiron i will buy this and use this no matter what other products i use love it 
2013-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|the macadamia styling oil was by far one of my favorite organix products it smelled so heavenly and did a lot to help my hair it was platinum blonde then when i used it in my damp hair and blow dried it i noticed that it wasn t nearly as frizzy and did well as a smoothing agent i really love organix products and frequently use their sea salt spray it is drying on my hair but if i use the macadamia oil to smooth and hydrate it it becomes a wonderful combination of beachy moisturized hair 
2012-08|4.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i use this on days when i m feeling lazy and don t feel like doing much to my hair in terms of styling just apply a nickel or quarter size amount to damp hair work into your hair and let your hair air dry my curls look shiny and soft and my hair never loses any volume i like the macadamia oil products line healing treatment oil much better but this is a cheap alternative it smells good and never leaves any residue on my clothes or my hat if i wear one my hair doesn t feel sticky so that s a plus also the awapuhi and ginger drying oil is the best imo if you like organix products 
2012-08|3.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i bought this on sale at the same time as the brazilian keratin dry oil and i preferred those oils on my hair slightly to this one this was ok but i didn t feel i needed both so i returned it the bottle design could be a lot better to prevent waste and messiness but not as bad as some organix products 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|this product is great i love it makes hair smooth scent is nice and one doesn t feel the need to wash hands after applying i wear a long ponytail everyday and this product keeps everything lovely would buy again and highly recommend it 
2012-08|3.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|at first i wasn t sure if i liked this because i m used to thicker serums however i ve noticed that it does make my hair really soft i prefer a pump which is why i rated a quot 1 quot for packaging i don t hate this product so i d likely purchase again 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|this has the same effect on my hair as the brazilian keratin therapy anti breakage serum this is a great leave in serum for defrizzing and softening my hair it distributes evenly and doesn t make my hair look greasy or weighed down just shinier 
2012-08|4.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|what a great product i put a dime size in my long thick hair before i blow dry and straighten it i always notice a difference in softness and silkiness and it smells great i also put this on the ends of my hair when it s dry to seal split ends my only complaint is that my hair doesn t ever come out shiny with this stuff oh well i still love the way it makes my hair feel 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|fabulous i can t say much more then that if i had to use 1 word to conclude my opinion on this product results zero frizzing or exposed split ends great for the desert and super easy to use after washing and conditioning it go s great in damp hair if there is slight frizzing the next day a drop takes the frizz away instantly no greasy residue conclusion my hair is super sleek shiny and manageable i do use the oil as a partner with the shampoo and conditioner all products went beyond expectation 
2012-08|4.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i have been using this dry oil on my hair all week and i really like it so far i m a little skeptical because it is on the thick side for an oil there is coconut and avocado oil in here in addition to macadamia and so i just had to try it i did notice my hair felt instantly soft my hair is thick and damaged so my hair soaks it up it does coat my hair slightly but i feel like it s in a good protecting kind of way i haven t notice any dryness or breakage on my weak areas on the ends of my hair so i like it for now i think this serum would be amazing if i wore my hair curly natural i straighten my hair everyday and usually thinner serums work better for that but this one i am really liking so far i will update if things change 
2012-08|3.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i m torn on this one that s why i give it a 3 i can t decide if i like it or not the first thing is it s a heavier oil than i expected in the grocery store i ve purchased macadamia oil for cooking and it s a much thinner oil i know they have to add stuff to make it more suited to hair styling but it was much heavier than i thought it would be contrary to a heavy oil i flat ironed my hair with this and the ends were dry and more split end looking i m not blaming organix for the state of my hair as i m guilty of heavy styling but i d expect a heavy oil like this to smooth my ends other organix hair serums smoothed my ends wonderfully and so does the got 2 b smoothing serums maybe this isn t meant for a person like myself maybe it works well for someone who isn t a heavy styler and hasn t bleached their hair more than once i might buy it again but only to use on damp hair i would then add another product for heat protection on top of the dry styling oil maybe i ll use it to smooth the ends after i ve styled 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i m on my second bottle of this stuff and i absolutely love it this is the first organix product i ve used it leaves my hair so soft and smells so great the bottle is a pain sometimes though the bottle gets oily sometimes the top also isn t that great i use about a quarter size of this and have to close the bottle really fast to make sure it doesn t spill i have long hair close to my belly button and i have days where it will feel damaged than days where it will be healthy due to the thickness i use this stuff everyday and i never have this problem anymore this never gets greasy on me but i m sure if you have thinner hair you would have to use it sparingly my first bottle lasted me almost two months with daily use and there s a good amount of product for the price its about seven dollars at walmart bottom line this is amazing 
2012-08|4.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i bought this after really liking the awapuhi dry styling oil it turned out to be thicker than the other dry oil which i wasn t expecting it felt a little weird in my hands compared to other serums and oils but it wasn t bad just different the smell is great although i do prefer the other in that area i applied this to damp hair after using the intensive mask from the same line i found it a little sticky and gummy when i first put it in and i took off 1 lippie for that after my hair dried some the feeling totally went away and wow was my hair amazing it was soft hydrated frizz free and straight i have a little bit of a wave that i d usually straighten and this is the first product that really did all those things for me i m thoroughly impressed even though there was that sticky feeling i ll be repurchasing 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|picked this up today and just used it have to say i m pleasantly surprised i bought the matching conditioner and shampoo i used all three and just let my hair air dry usually i m still pretty frizzy when i air dry even especially since my coppola express is fading but my hair actually looks soft and shiny didn t weigh my hair down like morroccan oil it s light like alterna kendi oil but at less than half the price 
2012-08|2.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|let me start by saying that i love organix argan oil treatment also i really liked the brand macadamia nut oil however organix s version of macadamia nut oil is not nearly as good as the original at first i loved it i blow dried and flat iron my hair after applying this product post shampoo my hair looked amazing soft bouncy shiny and very healthy by the next morning my hair was a mess it felt like gummy fluffy hay i couldn t re straighten it without tons of fly aways figuring maybe i used too much i washed it out and used a tiny bit same result completely unmanageable the next day the residue built up in my hair so badly that i looked like i had dandruff ugh i will definitely stick with organix argan oil treatment from now on 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i ve never really liked organix products i ve tried the shampoo and conditioners and just didnt feel like it did anything for my hair i love macadamia nut oil products and wanted a cheaper alternative and when i saw this i decided to give it a try i m so glad i did because this is now my hg product my long thick highlighted hair is thanking me now because it makes my hair so silky and shiny i included a description of my hair because im not sure how it will work on people with finer hair but if your hair is completely damaged this stuff is the answer to all your hair care problems plus it smells amazing 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i got a sample of this with the organix macadamia oil shampoo i tried it out for a few days and fell in love organix products are bogof at walgreens till the end of march so i definitely plan on going and picking up a few bottles of this because for the price you can t be beat i do find it a tad bit on the pricer side for a drugstore product but it sure beats the price of the regular macadamia line 
2012-08|4.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i got this product and organix awapuhi ginger dry styling oil for 7 99 at walgreens buy1get1free i had higher expectations for this product than the other one but this one let me down a bit i really didn t get any spectacular results i tried it one day and only put a small amount it made my hair soft for a while but did not get much shine my hair was back to being very dry the next day it also seemed to weigh my hair down a bit the next time i tried it i used much less and got the same results i still have plenty of product and plan to use the rest by putting a dollop or two in my conditioner for extra conditioning doing that hasn t given me any problems but using this on it s own was very underwhelming won t repurchase but it s worth a try if you like macadamia oil or perhaps find a sample somewhere some products are different depending on people and i can understand that edit okay i have changed my ratings i tried this product one more time and got good results i can only gather that the culprit for the bad results i got was my conditioner not the oil i ve used this product again twice after my review and got great results more toward the results i was looking for it doesn t imo work as great as other oils serums i ve used like argan oil but it left my hair shiny and managable would repurchase

2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i must admit i ve hated all the organix products i ve bought this is an exception in that i absolutely loooooove it i find that argan oil even the 100 kind with nothing added makes my hair amazing but then it always turns into a greasy mess this is probably my doing i usually put too much in and i m always touching my hair this stuff works so well with my bad hair manners i never feel like i actually have anything in my hair i use 2 small drops rub my hands together then tissue off some since i always end up with too much then i quot brush quot my hair with my hands fingers from midshaft to the ends focusing on the ends blowdry or air dry my hair ends up looking soft shiny and healthy three things it definitely is not hahaha as of now this is hg for me if you have colored hair that is wavy and medium coarseness i suggest trying this out 
2012-08|5.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|ok i am becoming a fan of the organix line from the start of me buying the morroccan oil line then the awapuhi ginger line and now the macadamia oil line i got this dry styling oil as a sample and was so impressed it smells so sweet and appealing like the nutty flavour of macadamia nut cookies baking on a winter afternoon and the quality of this product it left my old highlighted ends nice and soft and the rest of my feathered do so shiny this product is amazing and now i am torn to decide which of the oils i love the best morroccan awaphui brazilian or now the macadamia hmm i think i will use one every different day no need to take sides they are all wonderful excellent job organix 
2012-08|4.0|Macadamia Dry Styling Oil|i have to pick up every new oil that organix comes out with and i was curious about this one when it showed up at target i think macadamia oil is lighter than argan oil and their last line of argan products was a little too heavy for my hair on some days i still love the argan oil spray on very dry hair but this one seems more fluid and absorbs better into the hair shaft i don t mind that it doesn t spray on and i prefer to use it on damp hair 
2015-08|4.0|Argan Oil Of Morocco Dry Body Oil|i bought the oil for the hair loved it so much that i bought the body oil it smells so good it leaves the body so soft amd silky i pair it with the moroccan lotion by organix love it 
2015-08|1.0|Luxurious Moroccan argan Creme Sheer Opulence Masque|this product was a major disappointment and is what has put me off this brand for good while i haven t had any spectacular results with organix products in the past at the very least they more or less did what they were supposed to do in a mediocre fashion this product not only did nothing to condition my hair but i also experienced more tangles than usual after using it it gave my fine hair the texture of straw and made it knot like crazy i eventually had to slap raw shea butter on my hair and wet comb it carefully to get the developing rat s nest of a knot out i have never had such issues with my hair and i m not particularly fussy about hair products it has to be spectacularly bad to register i used up the bottle and have switched to another conditioner in the last week one day and my hair already feels much better silkier fuller and not tangled i liked the macadamia intensive moisture masque it came in the tub but mostly for the smell and i don t think i will ever buy another organix product again 
2014-08|3.0|Luxurious Moroccan argan Creme Sheer Opulence Masque|this product feels like a luxurious conditioner but the results are nothing special the smell is almost like an industrial cleaner or lava soap i got this for half price on clearance at cvs almost 5 00 usd for 6 7 oz all in all i wouldn t recommend this too expensive for the results you get and it s so thick it s probably clogging the drain pipe in my shower right now 
2013-08|4.0|Luxurious Moroccan argan Creme Sheer Opulence Masque|i was attracted to the sleek shiny gold tube with a flip cap the packaging says it is supposed to be the quot creme de la creme quot of the the whole organix moroccan argan line i will say that if you have had success with the other organix conditioners and treatments then you will really like this it smell very nice floral musk scent and the scent does not linger long on the hair i let it sit on my hair for around 3 to 5 minutes as suggested and then rinsed it off it has very good slip and took a bit to rinse clean yet my hair didn t feel like it had any residue when my hair air dried it had good texture and shine my hair was fairly easy to comb and did not look greasy what impressed me the most is that it lived up to it s claims of being smoothing it really helped to control frizz for me and left my hair soft i think it has good moisturizing abilities for my hair though i would disagree with the super moisturizing claims on the packaging but it does have a protein in it so those sensitive to that may want to avoid this one overall i did like this and will buy it again if there is a sale on it as it is a bit pricey for the amount you get 
2015-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Hibiscus Lotion|this lotion smells awsome it does hydrate the skin and feels smooth and velvety after it leaves a nice luminosity on the skin perfect for summer love it 
2014-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Hibiscus Lotion|i liked the smell of this lotion but it didn t moisturize enough for my taste i felt like i had to moisturize again like one hour later also there s glitter in it even if they don t advertise it anywhere on the bottle so it s good to know do not purchase this lotion if you hate glitter in your lotion the packaging is super pretty tho i will not repurchase but it wasn t a bad lotion just not for me 
2013-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Hibiscus Lotion|edit i was looking at my legs closely this weekend under the sun after having used this lotion and noticed that my legs were sparkling so i went into my bathroom grabbed the bottle of lotion squeezed some on to the back of my hand and sure enough there was a fair amount of glitter in there not liking that i am a pretty big fan of organix products and i freaking love their coconut scents so when i saw this on sale at shoppers drug mart i decided to pick this up unfortunately i am not crazy impressed with this lotion it is very smooth and light and rubs into your skin quite nicely but the moisturization isn t that great my skin certainly doesn t feel dry after using this but it doesn t feel quite moisturized enough i absolutely adore the scent though i love coconut scented products but this coconut scent is especially good and addictive i probably will repurchase this again because the spring and summer months are approaching and my skin doesn t need as much moisture in those months but i will find something else for winter 
2014-08|4.0|brasilian keratin therapy shimmering keratin oil|this is my go to hair oil if i don t have my favorite one makes hair soft smooth amp shiny makes combing easier just be careful not to use too much or your hair will look and feel greasy great product if used correctly smells ok reasonably priced 
2014-08|5.0|brasilian keratin therapy shimmering keratin oil|this is my holy grail product girls with thick curly unruly hair who flat iron read on i have very thick curly wavy hair that requires flat ironing with my babyliss nano at 450 degrees to tame i color every 4 weeks it is shoulder length and it takes me 45 minutes to section and straighten i touch it up daily with the flat iron as it needs taming constantly i even wear a shower cap and wash only once a week as the more product in my hair the easier to control my biggest challenge is after a wash so time consuming plus before this stuff it took a few days of adding product to reduce puffiness i use purelogy hydrate shampoo and terax conditioner and add purelogy hair oil now discontinued after flat ironing to help tame my hair sucks up a lot of product so i have to go lower end to flat iron most recently i have used the organix awapuhi ginger dry styling oil to flat iron not bad but a touch greasy i am always on the lookout for products that will help me flat iron and tame my hair so when i saw this in walmart for 6 76 i thought why not i have used this three times to do complete flat ironing and styling omg it is the best product i have ever found it makes my hair so soft and detangles as i flat iron it flattens my super thick hair down to a point that looks quot normal quot it s an easy spray on product big hair girls will understand this other products left my hair still puffy and with too much volume even after the flat iron it handles the heat of my flat iron and as a styling product adds a beautiful shine and softens beyond what i thought ever possible plus it smells nice kind of vanilla coconut i can even run a comb through my hair when i m done i will buy this forever and i just bought another seven of them its affordable if you hunt online you can get reduced prices i paid 5 75 a bottle at an ulta sale the bottle tends to slip a little while using due to the design but that means nothing to me given my results i ruled out a similar oil organix kukui oil in the store no softening at all i just bought the organix relaxing balm pump lotion that i applied to my dry ends after flat ironing and it worked well not sure if i need it but it s ok you must try this if you struggle with big thick curly hair that you want straight i m not sure if someone with finer hair would find it greasy but in my hair it is not and it does wonders 
2014-08|2.0|Vitamin B5 Conditioner|i m not 100 sure whether i should be writing this review for the b5 shampoo or conditioner as i m not exactly sure which is responsible for wrecking my hair i m going to blame the conditioner because in theory even if a shampoo causes you some problems a good conditioner should be able to go a long way in working out at least some of those problems i purchased both the shampoo and conditioner as i saw they were new and i m a sucker for trying new haircare products i have medium blonde hair that is dry and still a bit damaged from a salon haircolor disaster almost a year ago i have spent this past year buying and trying just about every moisturizing and or repairing haircare product that i can to restore my hair to the health and beauty it had before that hair salon owner tortured it it had really been starting to turn a corner in health and then i tried this the first time i used it my hair was really dirty and the shampoo certainly got it clean the conditioner feels very thick in hand and rinsed really clean but i noticed i did need a fair amount of detangler spray my hair also kind of had that quot dry quot feeling to it after it air dried the second time i tried both products it yielded about the same results but the third was a disaster this time i used them on hair that wasn t as dirty washed less than 24 hours before i shampooed as usual and applied the conditioner initially the conditioner felt good like i could actually feel my hair slipping around on my back the instant i got out of the shower i had an quot uh oh quot experience because i could literally feel my hair hardening and drying up i didn t really even towel my hair off and went straight to the mirror to add detangler spray even with a boatload of detangler i could hardly get my hair untangled i was snarly matted dry and tangly i lost a lot more hair than usual and i was so disappointed because this problem had so improved over the past few months prior to this incident my hair literally for days looked ratty and damaged it s actually still getting over this stuff i don t honestly know what the problem was the shampoo lathers nicely has a very pleasant light smell does a good job cleaning apparently too good and the conditioner seems like it is conditioning and adding slip also smells nice very light fragrance but holy cow when you get to styling be warned don t wait too long or you may never get a comb through your hair again and no i did not change my washing technique or anything else my hair is air dried basically every day and then worn up in a clip also every day very little changes in my hair routine as far as that goes i am disappointed perplexed and my hair is sorry and sad i would clearly not recommend either the shampoo or the conditioner to anyone who needs moisture in their haircare products 
2014-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|oh how i love the scent of this it makes me so happy i wish the bottles were larger or the price less because it really does not do anything for my hair other than smell good i would still buy this maybe just once a year when i want to take a long hot shower and have a little treat and unwind but because there is no benefit to my hair the bottles are so small and my hair very very long i have no other use for this but to make my senses happy and it does lol 
2014-08|3.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|the saving part of this product for me is the smell and that it is a light weight conditioner i love the smell and am a huge fan of mint as far as a conditioner is concerned i would not consider this an effective conditioner unless you have a light shampoo or oily hair it does not help with frizz but i also live in an area where if you step outside it feels like you re swimming for me it s a rather average conditioner i love the smell but there are tons of hair products out there that have great smells so i will likely not repurchase this one even though the 2 for 10 dollar sale heb often puts on this line may cause me to reconsider 
2014-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i really like this conditioner i use it along with the matching shampoo and it does a great job of softening my short medium textured hair as a mentioned when reviewing the shampoo this product is very strongly fragranced with mint and the scent lingers once your hair is dry so if you don t like mint don t buy this conditioner 
2013-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|06 2014 edit im not changing my ratings but the formula for this product has changed probably along with the brand name i bought it and noticed later so i havent decided if i m going to bother using it or not notably the alcohol was moved from the middle to the top and the jojoboa oil is gone this is the first conditioner i ve used that i really noticed my hair be much softer and shinier from it doesn t mean i never used one that was nice but i like this one a lot because there s no doubt in my mind it s working in the shower it isn t super slippery but it spreads well and actually makes my hair feel thickand full in a way that i haven t experienced with other products my shampoo makes my hair feel very non slick and flat and conditioner usually just makes it feel slick again but this is like wow i have a handfull of hair now the smell is pleasant in the bottle but a bit strong out of the bottle and lingers for a while out of the shower the tea tree is just the tiniest bit bitter or something so i don t love it but the main thing is that since i started using this i notice my hair feeling so soft looking less stringy and being all around shinier so that right there makes me want to buy it again or maybe try a different scent from this brand that has similar ingredients it is my first organix hair product but i have and like their arganoil body lotion i am using it in combo with alternating 2 shampoos giovanni teatree and h amp s sensitive something or other because i have dry scalp i do not put this conditioner on my scalp 
2013-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i looove this conditioner it is probably the best product that i ve ever used on my curly hair the matching shampoo by itself is very drying but has never left my hair in tangles and when paired with the matching conditioner leaves my hair completely silky and frizz free it is a bit pricey for a drugstore conditioner but definitely worth it for how well it works my only warning is that all of the organix bottles generally look the same so you need to be careful that you check the labels for shampoo and conditioner on them i ve made that mistake twice and ended up with several extra conditioner bottles 
2013-08|3.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i bought a large bottle of this shampoo and conditioner even though i usually stick with the shea butter and argan oil line i suggest using them together instead of mixing and matching because the shampoo isn t as gentle as other organix products this conditioner was okay i didn t notice the sleekness or shine that i get from the shea and argan line though 
2013-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i decided i wasn t going to buy organix hair care after all the negative reviews however my nana once had the moroccan argan shampoo and it was good along with my hair dye s step 3 conditioner so when she bought the tea tree mint shampoo amp conditioner i decided to try it just the shampoo might dry your hair out when i followed up with this i used it on the bottom half and waited 5 minutes before washing it out but when i felt my hair the top was a little dry compared to the rest so i put a little on the top and waited about 10 15 seconds before washing it out and it felt the same like it claims i had no problems with it affecting my bleach blonde in fact my hair feels soft looks beautiful and smells great let me tell you when lathering and it does lather well the smell is very strong but after washing it out it s noticeable but much more subtle i m not sure if i ll purchase this particular one as the peppermint y smell while good isn t my favorite next time i m at the store i smell test to see if others are better either way i definitely will be keep checking out organix products it s been hours and i can t stop touching my hair 
2012-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i cannot say that this conditioner yields any mind blowing results but it smells absolutely divine i love minty hair products this stuff smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream or orbit sweet mint gum the smell does not last that long outside the shower but it is positively yummy again even in tandem with the shampoo the organix line does nothing for me but i would probably buy it just for the smell 
2012-08|2.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|used this with the matching shampoo on my fine medium thickness straight hair the conditioner did not have enough moisture to make up for how stripping the shampoo was might be a fine light weight conditioner on its own but not paired with the matching shampoo 
2012-08|3.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|it took me a few showers to notice this but this specific conditioner had sooo much of my hair stripping off i wouldn t even have to comb and distribute this product throughout my hair for strands of my hair to come out which was such a shame because i really loved the smell of it i decided to continue using this product but only with the use of another conditioner as well i had used ojon damage reverse along with it i still use this organix conditioner mostly because i want to finish off the bottle before i start using a new conditioner overall this product was ok it smelled great and made my hair seem somewhat fuller although this product doesn t really detangle and strips off strands of my hair this product works really well when used with other conditioners though 
2012-08|1.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this is the second worst organic conditioner i ve ever tried david babaii for wildaid conditioners top my list though this smelled wonderful but it dried out my hair i left it in longer hoping this would help but nope this was a dud 
2012-08|3.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i use this conditioner after using the tea tree mint shampoo and it makes my hair shiny soft and silky on days that i blow dry and straighten i feel like using heat products activates something in the conditioner that helps hair look and feel especially shiny and soft my boyfriend uses the conditioner as well and says he has noticed the same thing when he blow dries his hair however on days where i don t use heat styling products it makes my hair a bit more dry i have fine straight wavyish black hair also the conditioner runs out fairly quickly unlike the shampoo i usually have to squeeze out a considerable amount of product for use each time i bought the tea tree in the hopes that it would also help get rid of dandruff but i haven t noticed a significant change either way it is a decent product i like the organix line the smell is amazing and not too over bearing the mint scent also helps to wake me up in the morning overall i would recommend this product especially if you blow dry and or straighten on a regular basis 
2011-08|1.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|oh my god this thing its actually call a conditioner next to what water it smells so good kinda like mint ice cream i accidentally bought two thinking i got the shampoo instead bad mistake for not returning it instead in once use it took half the freaking bottle for it to barely moisturize my curly medium thick oily hair that says something that it doesnt do anything true it has some nice ingredients but it left my hair really dry damaged and full of knots i had to use a hair mask to counter balance the havoc it caused my poor hair now i have two bottles that i have no use for 
2011-08|2.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this conditioner didn t do much that i could notice when i put it on my wet hair it seemed to soak in and didn t even make my hair slippery then i rinsed it out and my hair seemed to have a waxy coating not great for fine wavy highlighted slightly dry hair 
2011-08|5.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|great for african hair smells good made my hair soooo silky and sooo shiny hair was a lot straighter and smoother when i flat ironed it dramatic decrease in breakage during styling made my hair bouncy great product looking forward to trying other organix products 
2011-08|2.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i have relaxed hair and was searching for sulfate and paraben free products to baby my super dry hair this product is just not rich enough i thought i had wasted my money until i started using coconut oil as a pre wash conditioning treatment after washing with the tea tree shampoo and using this as a creme rinse seriously that is all this really is my hair is soft fresh and manageable very shiny and much healthier if you have seriously dry hair try this combination otherwise i would look for another natural product for moisturizing 
2011-08|3.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i enjoy this line of shampoos and conditioners but this one did nothing for me i have used tea tree conditioners in the past and it helped with my dandruff but this one didn t seem to contain enough tea tree to make a difference it didn t tingle or smell too minty 
2010-08|1.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this conditioner is by far the worst conditioner i have ever used i initally bought it because i love the minty smell but other than that there is no benefit to using this product i have long color treated semi oily hair my current routine for using the organix shampoo and conditioner is to wash my hair with the shampoo leave on for approximately 3 minutes rinse apply conditioner leave on for approximately 5 minutes rinse apply conditioner again leave on for another 3 then rinse even with though i use the conditioner twice it leaves my hair so ridiculously dry and damaged looking i will never buy this product again or anything from the organix brand i am extremely dissatisfied 
2010-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this is really minty and very refreshing i usually take my showers at night so it kept me awake but this would be great in the morning it conditions very well i m not going to buy it again because of the scent but it works really well 
2010-08|2.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i bought this because it smells so awesome i m looking for more natural products so i was excited to try it upon first usage i noticed that it doesn t feel like a conditioner i m used to it s not thick and creamy when applied to the hair it almost seems like it s not even there i have to use alot of product to cover my thin medium length hair almost a palmful while with other conditioners like dove tresemme etc i only use a quarter sized squeeze this is because it doesn t contain silcone chemicals that coat your strands my hair felt great fresh out of the shower and that sweet mint smell lingered for awhile however the next day my hair felt so stringy tangled and unmanagable weird because my hair is always soft shiny and healthy i won t buy this conditioner again for now i ve been mixing it with pantene for scent purposes and to use it up what s the point of this stuff anyways i m jealous of everyone this has worked for the scent is so lovely 
2010-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|these lines of hair products seem nice i really like this one i ve tried the cucumber yogurt conditioner and its pretty good too i use it in the winter and periodically through the year after i get my highlights and low lights touched up it leaves my hair feeling so nice only two complaints are that i wish the mint smell was stronger and i wish they would redo their bottle shape cap
2010-08|1.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this conditioner did nothing for my hair it didn t hydrate or detangle what s the point very disappointed with this 
2010-08|3.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this shampoo isn t terrible but would never be my hg either its not at all moisturizing but doesn t dry out my hair its just ehh lol if you have dry hair i can see how it would overly dry it honestly if i didnt use my weekly deep conditioner it might even dry out my hair a bit the only reason it gets three stars is because it gives my head this amazing tingly feeling that really wakes you up in the morning and it smells amazing 
2010-08|5.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this is my holy grail conditioner i love organix shampoos and conditioners im a natural haired sister so i love that their products are sulfate and paraben free for such a cheap price because i cowash several times a week i go thru alot of this my only draw back is that you dont get alot of product for the price oh and did i mention the smell and the awesome tingle this is very moisturizing so if you have dry hair this is a really great product to try 
2010-08|1.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i m really surprised that so many people like this conditioner i have long straight hair with a bit of dryness but no frizz i purchased this because i ve been trying to use more natural products and i love anything with tea tree oil i really wanted to like this brand but unfortunately this product didn t deliver for me while it did an okay job of detangling my hair when in the shower i was left with constant tangles for the rest of the day i can t believe that didn t bother anyone else i couldn t even run my fingers through my hair also i noticed that my hair was full of static and it s august i can t imagine what would happen if i used this in the winter my hair was really limp and even the color looked more dull lastly the tea tree oil smell was weakened by an uber sweet vanilla note that sort of ruined the usual greener smell of the tea tree if the conditioner worked then i would be able to handle the smell but it was definitely not worth it for me i m a stickler for using a product until it s gone but i think i might have to ditch this one honestly you d be better off buying a 99 cent bottle of suave 
2010-08|5.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this is great if your hair is dry it doesn t have any sulfates to dry out your hair also it s really moisturizing really good for winter the only bad thing about is that it can make your hair really knotted up so beware it smells really nice like a vanilla mint but is sort of expensive for a drugstore brand around five to seven u s dollars 
2010-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this is a great conditioner especially when i use it after using an organix shampoo my hair is tangle free and so easy to comb out even with other shampoos it does a great job of detangling it also smells really good almost like thin mints the downside is that the bottle is a little small for the price and i go through conditioner really quickly however since switching to organix products which are effective but not harsh on my hair i ve been able to cut back to washing every other day so i guess it works out ok price wise 
2010-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|invigorates my scalp with a slight cool tingle invigorates my spirit with the bright fresh smell i was worried that mint conditioner would smell like toothpaste or that tea tree would smell medicinal but the two together seem to work perfectly i do get more tangles than i d like with this and i have to use a good heavy squeeze each time to get enough to cover my head but it s pretty darn effective at smoothing my long thick wavy hair and doesn t weigh it down at all 
2009-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i love the way organix products smell i would use the shampoo but it s too moisturizing for my hair the conditioner is great though very thick and creamy too i m not sure if it s the best in its price range but i love the smell it does condition my hair nicely and i like the packaging i bought enough to last me for a year because i buy them when they are on sale 
2009-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i was looking for a new conditioner and i ended up buying this one now this is my hg conditioner i love the smell and tea tree oil is good for the hair and scalp so you cant go wrong with this my only problem is the bottle is way to small i would like if they sold different sizes that way i can buy the biggest bottle they carry but either way i plan to buy this conditioner again 
2009-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|this is a pretty good conditioner it leaves enough moisture without drying the hair out and without weighing it down i just adore the smell it smells like mint peppermint patties i also like the shampoo from this line i do this the bottle had grip marks as it can be slippery 
2009-08|2.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i deleted my review and i no longer own this i don t even remember what happened to it it was lost or given away i have never liked organix shampoo s or conditioners but their other hair care are all good i prefer the shine and oil sprays 
2009-08|1.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|wow i am shocked all these people like this i have very easy to manage hair its straight and very healthy since its short that being said this conditioner did absolutely nothing for me in the shower this doesn t have any moisturizing feel at all after its rinsed out my hair feels exactly the same as before shampooing after its dry it feels the same as if i didn t condition at all its a waste of 7 also the bottle is exactly the same shape and color as the shampoo so you have look carefully at which bottle you are grabbing super annoying 
2009-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i love the smell of this conditioner it makes my hair soft and seems to help reduce the frizz i have naturally curly hair i suffer from dry scalp and eczema in the winter and this cures it i mean it s gone only cons is that it s pricey for drug store brands and the bottle is hard to handle in the shower i ve been using for about 2 years now 
2008-08|5.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i loved this product so much i had to come and post about it lol i have really tight kinky curl mixed confused hair lol this product made my hair so ultra smooth to the touch in the shower my hair became straight and out back to being curly but still tangle free you should def check this product out 
2008-08|4.0|Tea Tree Mint Conditioner|i love the smell of this seems to condition pretty well i ve only used it a few times though and plan to update after a couple weeks the bottle is too cute although a bit awkward in the shower 
2014-08|4.0|Hydrating Moroccan Argan Dry Body Oil|i picked this up at rite aide while on vacation on a whim i use it after a shower and it moisturizes well doesn t make my skin too shiny i tried it as a bath oil last night and wow i soaked and shaved and my skin felt amazing my legs are super smooth and i just feel soft and happy all over i only wish it didn t have mineral oil but it is better than most things i have used that do sometimes mineral oil makes my skin feel nasty but this is very light also the first dry oil i have used 
2014-08|3.0|Hydrating Moroccan Argan Dry Body Oil|i was looking for a cheap alternative for my nuxe huile prodigieuse or for days when shimmer wasn t necessary and since i ve used the organix argan oil in my hair before with decent results i decided to give this a try the price is great about 8 for 200ml vs 40 for 50ml of the nuxe availability is great smells nice but it has a few more chemicals in it than i would like and it stays greasy a bit longer than the nuxe but the effect is similar minus shimmer of course happy to save my special oil for special occasions and use this inbetween 
2014-08|5.0|Hydrating Moroccan Argan Dry Body Oil|i love how quick and easy this is to use this is the last thing i do in the shower squirt very little on each arm and leg and rub it in very little goes a long way rinse for a few seconds under the water and done my skin is smooth and soft and not at all oily or slick i don t have very dry skin so maybe some people need to use more than just this but i ll use lotion on top if i have time to kill but not necessary i personally love the smell and i also sniffed it before i bought it so i wouldn t end up like people on here complaining about the smell of things overall it s around 6 and has lasted me for six months maybe more and i m only little more than half way through it buying it again for sure 
2014-08|3.0|Hydrating Moroccan Argan Dry Body Oil|this dry oil does feel luxerious initially and it has a pleasant scent and does dry into the skin very nicely however after some time i do not notice any obvious benefit to my skin i don t have overly dry skin but i don t feel that the moisturizing effect of this product is very hydrating it is nice and silky and makes my skin feel smooth immediately putting it on but i am not sure that it is helping the quality of my skin in the long haul as others have pointed out the bottle is very flimsy and it s hard to pour out a gradual amount and this seems like a really poor packaging design i find myself using this product each night after i shower but i am not sure that i will replenish it after i use up the bottle i think i will be on a quest to find a more hydrating dry oil product 
2013-08|4.0|Hydrating Moroccan Argan Dry Body Oil|love love love the smell but i wish the smell lasted longer it fades after 10 minutes the oil quickly absorbs in the skin instead of just staying on top of your skin thats a plus it does what it says it will do nothing more nothing less its hard to pour it out without creating a mini mess the hole to pour out from is very wide so even when you pour just a bit out the rest runs down over the bottle its hard to describe but anyone who has it knows what im talking about its great if you want some light oil to moisturize your skin but if you are dry stay away from this this will not solve issues concerning very dry skin this is very light i would use this on vacation or on a beach
2013-08|2.0|Hydrating Moroccan Argan Dry Body Oil|this is the first organix product i ve ever bought i ve seen the line before and read reviews on their other products but nothing really jumped out to me as a quot must try quot while grocery shopping a few weeks ago i spotted the hydrating moroccan argan dry body oil which is evidently a new product on the shelf and picked it up because i m super lazy and hate putting lotion for the past year or so i ve been using neutrogena s sesame oil which i really love but unfortunately i ve only been able to find the regular scented version which i really really don t like first the good points this oil is fairly moisturizing and has a decent smell i m not scent sensitive but i could see how someone who is might find the smell slightly overpowering i wouldn t say the smell is yummy or anything one would want to douse themselves in to me this smells a little plastic y weird i know and slightly tropical in a fake they totally added scent to this way the scent is infinitely better than the old lady floral scent the neutrogena folks use for their oil however as for moisturizing this does a fair job per the directions this can be rinsed off after you apply it in the shower or you can smooth it on after your shower while still damp and pat dry for quot extra moisturizing quot i use the latter method and it does keep my dry skin somewhat in check i still have to apply lotion to my elbows dry city hands and feet so it s not a catch all since this is a dry oil you re not going to look like an oil slick even if you apply too much it sinks it rather quickly so if you re looking for something that you can apply and not be forced to wait for it to soak in this is your oil i believe i paid around 7 for a 6 8 ounce bottle which is about as much as a good drugstore lotion so the price is alright i also haven t had an adverse reaction to anything in this no weird bouts of body acne or anything like that but since the skin on my body is basically bulletproof i m not the best gauge for sensitivity now the bad points this isn t as moisturizing as neutrogena s sesame oil or even plain old baby oil by a long shot with neutrogena my skin is still soft the next day with organix not so much i think the main reason for that is this quot moroccan argan oil quot is mainly compromised of good old fashioned mineral oil my biggest problem with this oil however is the bottle when i first picked this up in the store the top popped off without me squeezing it the top itself is one of those weird designs that is slightly slanted and just pops off instead of screwing on to me this is the worst design for a bottle of liquid let alone an oil that you re suppose to use in a wet environment i figured i picked up a bum bottle so i chose one that was at the back of the shelf after i got it home i noticed that it was leaking in the bag as soon as i took it out of the bag the top popped off again i managed to keep the top on for a while and used it with relatively few problems the top popped off twice when i used it but i caught it both times but earlier this evening i accidentally knocked the bottle over and about half the oil poured down the drain perhaps the store i went to got a defective batch but if goofy pop off tops are the norm i ll use something else i m still undecided if i ll repurchase this because i m a bit irritated by the bottle design and losing half the product down the drain it s a decent enough product that is moderately priced but i don t know anyone who doesn t mind spending 7 for something in a shoddy bottle i think i ll use up what s left of the bottle and go back to neutrogena even though its a little more expensive edit to add i finally found a bottle of the neutrogena unscented oil that i love so much i stopped using this organix nonsense because it wasn t as moisturizing and i found i still had to apply lotion to my hands knees feet and elbows 
2014-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|this has great smoothing properties without being greasy and it has a nice coconut and cocoa butter scent my hair adores keratin based products and this is a good addition to my hair serum collection it softens and gives my hair gloss and is wonderful for heat styling it is moderately heavy so i like to reserve it for days when i don t wear my hair curly helps a lot with manageability i can say that the anti breakage claims are accurate as i have experienced less hair fall out in the shower i wish this came with a pump but i can tolerate it 
2014-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|my absolute favorite hair serum previously before switching to all organix products my thick black hair was a frizzy coarse unhealthy mess i started smoothing this serum into my hair from mid shaft to the ends after showering i ve been using this consistently for about two years now and the result is amazingly shiny healthy smooth hair although it doesn t make my hair perfectly quot straight quot i quite love how this makes my natural waves look i get so many compliments on my hair which used to be unheard of considering what a mess it used to be running my fingers through my hair is an enjoyable experience now and this product really has boosted my confidence my only complaint is that i wish this came in a pump container but this is very minor considering how amazing this serum really is i only use a smaller than a dime sized amount and this is enough for my long thick hair i can t seem to find it in stores anymore but this is very inexpensive on amazon around 6 and quite worth it 
2014-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|this is amazing stuff i was previously using the moroccan argan oil penetrating oil but it seemed to be a bit heavy then i tried this brazilian keratin therapy anti breakage serum and wow what a difference it is much lighter in weight than the penetrating oil i thought that a heavier weight serum would be better but it turns out that the lighter weight anti breakage serum is even better for my medium coarse sometimes dry hair it does have a slightly coconut or tropical scent but i only notice it when i first put it on my hair i use it after i ve wrapped my hair up in a towel to dry a bit and then apply this product right before i blow dry i smooth it down on my ends and the longer parts of my hair and then when i flip my hair up i use what s left on my palms to smooth down the fly aways at the crown of my head i ve been really happy with it the only drawkback so far is that this comes in an opaque container so i can t see exactly how much product is left i can kind of use the weight of the container to estimate how much i have left but i d really prefer a clear container so as to better guess when i need to repurchase 
2014-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|this is an awesome serum i used to be a daily straightening kind of girl until i learned the right way for my to style my curls anyway i recently had my hair highlighted and layered the girl used a flat iron on my hair n it looked ok a bit frizzy the next morning i used this product and my straightener a kqc and it was fantastic i didnt want to do anything except play with my hair soo fast forward a week i have co washed my hair twice since and this morning i flat ironed and its flipping awesome its hair days like this that make me want to do it everyday long story short love this product best serum ive ever used 
2014-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i really like this serum it smooths my hair beautifully and it smells divine it s not too heavy and it makes my hair super soft the only thing i don t like about it is the packaging i really hate the opening lid because its prone to leakage it also can pop open too easily so not that great for travelling i wish it had it a screw top or a pump with another lid like most serums 
2014-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i love this serum i only use it when my hair is flat ironed to keep fly a ways in check smells great a little goes a long way 
2013-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i wasn t too keen on buying this but it works fine with relaxed hair if you like using natural products this isn t for you it s not water based however i love using this after i finish washing my hair on occasions i ll use this before i walk out the door just a tad and my hair has so much body from it 
2013-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i am so happy with this serum i saw an obvious change after the first use i got this and the hydrating macadamia oil intensive moisture mask as part of a bogo free at walgreens last week i only wash my hair up to 2x a week so i don t get a lot of chances to review hair products this just had such an impact i had to share right away i have a ton of products for my hair most are the repairing type not for styling i have naturally wavy hair made more wavy with the new ish l oreal sea salt spray in the purple bottle but with winter coming i knew i wasn t being good to my hair so when i saw i d only have to pay 7 for 2 organix products i picked those products in the end they only had 3 or 4 of the quot lines quot from organix though so be aware of that anyways i used a dove shampoo the macadamia mask as a conditioner my usual after shower products and this serum i showered at night let my hair air dry as i always do didn t really do anything but parted my hair i went out when i got back home i noticed my bangs looked as if they were straightened it was really interesting today i see my hair is almost completely frizzless i ve been touching my hair a lot so that s prolly why there s any at all it s not poofy at the bottom like it usually is and for the most part the upper half of my hair is straight then the bottom half has loose s shaped waves with wispy ends i can t believe how well it straightened my hair with no heat also my hair is shiny healthy looking for once i have ombre hair poor bleached ends i can t get over it _ 
2013-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i love this product it smells great and leaves my hair absolutely amazing first of all it makes my hair shiny second it makes it totally soft i follow the directions at the back and let it air dry while i walk to school when i get there my hair has little to no frizz the serum is like a detangler because my hair gets really tangled and this serum does an absolute amazing job at detangling i use the matching shampoo and conditioner and my hair looks and feels healthy less frizzy bouncy and amazing this product really does make my hair straighter i love it after not using the line for about 5 months my hair was a disaster it was very hard to comb through my hair is really dull lifeless damaged frizzy and just plain awful im going to wait until its on sale and repurchase the serum shampoo and conditioner and if i have enough money maybe the shimmering oil
2013-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i like the smell of most of the organix line amp this one is no diffrent smells like summer but i never really noticed a diffrence between them and my moms suave she used to make me use as a teen but this was on sale amp my daughter has curly spring curls amp needs a little defrizzing that her deva curl wasnt totally helping with so i decided to give this a try it makes both my kids hair shiny amp silky wich dont happen often as they inherted my thick hair amp their dads kinky thick hair im hlf alskan native my husband amp their father is hlf black my daughter has sumwhat fine thick springy curls and most african hair products are to heavy amp greasy for her but regular curl products dont moistuize enuf my sons hair has thick course hair that has lost some of its curl do to us having it shaved off frequently he luvs his curlies but dont wanna take care of it everyday so he dont go to school with flat spots amp poof he can use the heavier stuff but with 4 people in the house with diffrent hair types its nice to find a product that works for everyone i can use this in my thick fine straight hair amp its not to greasy looking amp dont weight my hair down i dont use heat tools but i can only use this once between shampoos with my kids i put this on everyday after spritzing it damp so i can comb tangles put that in then a little dolop of deva curl arc angel amp pencil curl to help define the curls better the gel holds amp the oil adds shine amp softness for me it just adds shine amp softness but u only need a little at a time working ur way up this i def something i will keep using this for my family
2013-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i had really high hopes for this oil i have some good things to say and some bad things as well first of all it smells amazing kinda like the smell of butterscotch candy i followed the directions and put it on my towel dried hair the product was really thick and kind of greasy i have color treated amp very damaged blonde hair so my hair soaked the product up it seemed to make my hair really soft until i straightened it my hair felt kind of stiff and dirty and the serum felt really heavy i after straightening my hair it wasn t shiny one bit and didn t do what other hair serums do to my hair the product is okay i don t think i will buy it again 
2013-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i tried to put it on like the instructions said damp hair and blow dry but i have fine hair so it left it greasy and weighed down instead i use garnier fructis silk and shine smoothing lotion right out of the shower then blow dry my hair as normal and then apply a small amount of this product focusing on not getting too much on the roots it instantly straightens my hair and makes it less peicy and it obtains a fabulous luster i have really damaged and long hair and it made the breakage less visable the shine makes it look so healthy and luscious and i love the smell it s so tropical and makes me think of warm weather in the dead of winter so i found some use of this product altering the directions hopefully it can work out for anyone else who gives it a try pretty bad reviews on here 
2013-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|it s decent not the best i use it when i travel because the bottle is small i don t love it but it s better than nothing 
2012-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|ok a few things i am not a huge organix fan to start i bought 3 products on sale this last time and returned two but i kept this the bottle design is kind of crappy so you just have to be careful with it also i don t straighten or have straight hair i just know my hair likes the oils in this so over all i like this since i kept it and i like that the ingredients were overall pretty natural and silicone i think this works pretty well but nothing is a miracle i do find i like it better than other more drying serums or other oil products i do love the smell i tend to use this after dying bleaching i may try the coconut one next since it also has good reviews 
2012-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i have used this a few times now and can day i have been fairly suprised by this serum because it wasn t hugely pricey i didn t have the highest expectations because my hair is so dry and damaged from straightening i usually find that the more expensive products work the best however on this occasion i have found this serum to be suprising it has made my hair softer shinier healthier looking as well as making it better to straighten whats even better is that you don t need a lot to see a difference in the condition of the hair which is why it comes in a neat little bottle would definitely consider buying it again if it continues to work well on my hair 
2012-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|this is a great leave in serum for defrizzing and softening my hair it distributes evenly and doesn t make my hair look greasy or weighed down just shinier 
2012-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i used to be one of those who would much rather prefer tying their hair in a knot to spare themselves from the trouble this product is literally fantastic it is very cheap for a serum so i honestly did not expect much from it but it has miraculously rescued my fine hair that i have been trying to healthily grow for ages my ends are now way shinier and healthier after blow dry and straightening i feel much more confident about letting my hair down now amazing 
2012-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i love this serum i ve always been on a hunt for the perfect leave in product for the ends of my hair that will add shine strength and moisture and i ve finally found it i use this after i towel dry clean hair or when my hair is dry too it leaves my ends feeling very silky and shiny i highly recommend this serum 
2012-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i have pretty mixed feelings about this serum on the one hand i do feel that my hair gets a little stronger after using nothing miracle like but still noticeable the serum is somewhat thin which i actually appreciate it s easy to distribute through my hair but it also runs out of the bottle really easily and you end up with too much product the smell s ok not my favorite but not unbearable either a bottle does last forever though i personally just don t see enough of a difference in my hair to repurchase 
2012-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|this product is my absolute favorite smell in the world i find a little goes a very long way but you have to be careful because the product is quite runny i bought this for 7 at ulta which i think isn t bad because there are a ton of uses in one bottle i apply it to my ends after towel drying and i think it makes a huge difference when i straighten my hair i typically have relatively dry hair that is very curly so it is nice when my ends look healthy after flat ironing 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i was so excited to try this product as i have heard a lot about keratin i was disappointed with the packaging it is a very runny watery product and the way they made the bottle isn t very practical aside from the annoying bottle this product works wonders i have been using a chi straightener for about a year with no heat protection needless to say my hair has a lot of breakage this product smoothed down my hair and made it straight and shiny my hair color which i am not thrilled with looked so much better my hair pulled more red than brown this time it was dyed and the hard water in my area makes it look more orangey i m waiting to get it dyed an ash brown until i go home for thanksgiving break but this product helps it look more polished in the meantime i will continue to use this no matter what my future hair color is because it looks so good the one downside is that i can tell this will leave build up quickly i will have to use a clarifying shampoo once or twice a week to get my hair refreshed overall this is a great and cheap product oh and it smells awesome too 
2011-08|2.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i loved the name of the product sounds so exotic as its beautiful smell however the product was too much like liquid for its packaging quality and so there was some excessive wastage firstly i have waste length hair that everyone comments on how beautiful and smooth it is because i am obsessed with its condition to the point i always wear a hat to protect it from the sun the product is good at protecting the hair shaft making it smooth and detangle however the oil in the product is hard to remove so i had to shampoo it quite a bit read damaging to remove it making my hair dry as you should not scrub the long lengths with a shampoo the worst in summer it make my hair so itchy and i started breaking out in dermatitis and flies love that coconut smell in summer as the heat starts making smell like vomit after a while so sad 
2011-08|2.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i was really hoping to be in love with this stuff oils work very well on my hair but this one did not it actually made my hair frizzier than anything it did speed up drying time it made my hair kind of dull at first but then after i straightened my hair i put a little bit more on and it made it a little more shinier but not much my hair honestly looks way better without it i always get compliments on my hair and i couldn t wait to wash this stuff out of my hair and i honestly didn t notice any difference in helping with the breakage it does smell amazing though thats pretty much the only thing i liked about this product it is pretty expensive for such a little bottle but a little goes a long way with this and it will last you for a while no matter what type of hair you have the way it s packaged can get kind of messy after a while but i still think the bottle is cute it s honestly nothing special not worth the money i would not repurchase there are so many better products than this not a fan of organix products 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|yes i will buy this again and again and again i m writing a review for this serum in particular as opposed to the handful of others i ve tried recently as it s been making noticeable improvements in my hair i have other serums that i love but this one is pretty special first off i don t trust organix hair products much due to their consistently awful reviews and because i tried their morroccan oil and it sucked i got this serum knowing it s organix and taking the risk since the ingredients list is quite unique and i wanted a protein infused alternative to my regular serums not only does it have keratin but there s other goodies in there like avocado oil and coconut oil the packaging is like most other reviewers have stated annoying yes it s a cute shape and has a pretty brown and gold color scheme but the bottle s opening just makes dispensing the product a messy ordeal i like serums with pumps it s just more logical and efficient of course it s what s on the inside that counts though this serum is non sticky relatively light goes on smooth and smells amazing i use a couple of nickel sized drops on my wet hair after detangling note this amount might be too much for some as i have very thick hair run it through and let air dry as my hair air dries it s so much shinier healthier softer and plumper than when i use other serums the fragrance doesn t really linger unfortunately but that s not a problem frizz is basically obliterated but my volume isn t taken away in the process my curls look defined and shiny and maintain flow i truly wish i could use this serum every time i wash my hair but i wouldn t want my locks to get used to it and protein overloads are never a good thing this brilliant serum is definitely staying on my dresser and i ll continue to repurchase doesn t hurt that it s not too pricey either d 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|it smells amazing like other reviews the packaging is a bit of a problem but its worth it cuz the product inside is fantastic it makes my hair straight soft and shiny i picked it up for only 4 dollars at target on sale im so happy to have found this 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|this product is awesome i color my hair alot amp my hair has been breaking off i found this at harmon s beauty store and decided to try it it has helped my hair so much i ve noticed a difference the first time using it my hair is so soft and doesnt break off in the shower as much before it makes the elasticity of your hair much stronger you don t have to use a lot just a dab in the palm of your hands and work through from roots concentrating on the ends after that i add a heat protector to hair and blow out it adds shine softness and makes your hair durable when styling i love this i wasn t expecting much because of the price it really surprised me def buy this product 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|this is the best thing that ever happened to my hair first of all i have a tumultuous relationship with my hair we ve been through a lot and lately i ve been on the hunt to find a great product that will give my thick wavy and naturally dry hair a serious makeover organix products have always piqued my interest for some reason probably because of their beautiful scents and the yummy sounding names i saw this brazilian keratin serum on the shelf at cvs and gave it a whiff so good it s a very warm and intoxicating scent kind of like fresh coffee and cocoa beans but that s probably because of the cocoa butter in the ingredients there s also coconut oil keratin avocado oil and alot of cones in the list this serum is different than others i ve tried it doesn t make my hair feel greasy or coated in oils it s actually pretty light i worked a good amount into my damp towel dried hair and then after it dried i rubbed a small amount all over my head concentrating on the ends my hair is now sleek plush healthy lustrous and frizz free it s summer it s hot it s humid that s a recipe for disaster for my hair i get very frizzy waves but this even made it straight it also aids in protecting the hair from breakage which is excellent since i m trying to grow my hair really long this has definitely become an hg product for me i will repurchase and repurchase and repurchase the only negative thing i have to say is that too much of the product can squirt out of the tube sometimes and something with a pump or different packaging would be less messy other than that total perfection loving my hair right now 
2011-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i have long straight hair that has a tiny bit of a natural wave i used this product for the 1st time this morning and i used a silver dollar sized amount i towel dried hair which i definitely thought was too much after blowdrying and straightening it felt oily but soft it also was completely stick straight about an hour into my day i noticed it felt a lot less oily and very soft about 3 hours into my day there was a sudden downpour in fl summer heat and i got pretty wet normally my hair rain humidty awful frizzy huge hair but after my hair naturally dried while i was outside i brushed it and realized it was super soft and without an ounce of frizz i am completely amazed 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|wow i used to use the john frieda lite serum but its been discontinued i used up the last of my stash and was forced to find a replacement i was worried as i have baby fine hair and most serums just weigh my hair down i read the reviews on this product and checked it out i m in love this is as light as the john frieda but smells 100x better not greasy unless you pile it on controls frizzies in humid florida summer weather and gives a mirror like shine easy to wash out too doesn t weigh your hair down what else i love that my hair feels like silk when i run my hand through it i have some seriously sexy hair now my only complaint is the packaging a pump would be less messy 
2011-08|1.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i am sadly disappointed with my high hopes for this product i have been wanting to try a moroccan oil for some time and was deciding between this and the blue argan bottle of this by organix i chose this based on the reviews below i found the formula to be sticky and heavier than what i used to use biosilk and that it did not improve the condition of my hair or allow for easier styling or improved slip i bought it the day after i cut my hair from bra length to above shoulder length too so i imagined this would make my hair really great perfect after removing six inches of length it is about as heavy as the john frieda serum you have to apply to wet hair maybe that is what i should try next rather than damp my hair just felt sticky and gross after i applied the pea size amount and i had to wash my hands before blowing dry i have had a lot better luck with biosilk which i can apply on my skin after i use it not sticky at all even though it is a cone and i have had good luck with garnier s clear anti frizz sleek and shine serum i didn t care much for john frieda s just due to heaviness and how it felt on my hair and that is how i feel about the organix one too sad 
2011-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i love love love this stuff i feel like i m always on the hunt for something to help me get control of my hair that seems to be misbehaving all the time just when i thought i was out of luck enter organix i applied the product to towel dried hair that was still a little damp i just let my hair airdry for the rest of the day when i would take my hair out of the bun it was in all day instead of a curly frizzy mess it was still wavy but smoother it has cut down my styling time literally in half it doesn t get rid of the natural curl i have but makes it soo much easier to style it s cheap smells ah mazing like coconut cotton candy the packaging is a little awkward but is a great size if you travel a lot all in all it s fantastic for all you curly wavy haired babes out there 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i ve beenusing this along with the shampoo and conditioner to maintain my coppola keratin treatment i mix it in with the shampoo and the conditioner in the shower then i put it on my towel dried hair before blow drying it smells great and works well to smooth and shine my hair i m not thrilled with the package and find that i either get too much or too little overall this is well worth the money and a great drugstore find i will never go back to moroccan oil again 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i wanted to use this for a good bit of time before i wrote this review i love this stuff i use it on wet hair before styling and almost daily on dry hair just to give some polish and shine i pour about a nickel size in my palms rub together and just go over my whole head if that makes any sense the smell is nice but not loud or overpowering it does not make my hair look greasy it soaks right in and just gives a perfect effect it makes my very dry hair look healthy and shiny and easier to style i like this 100 times better than morrocan oil i will definitely buy again the bottle is lasting a long time though because it does not take much to do the trick i don t recall the price but i got it al walmart and i don t think it was very expensive at all 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|so i couldn t resist i had to go out amp get this today my inner product junkie has been out of control lately p but this stuff wow it did not disappoint at all my hair really doesn t have breakage problems nor have i ever really seen a split end it s just dry amp since this product has great ingredients i just thought i d give it a try avocado oil is reallllly great for my kind of hair fine wavy it actually did smooth my hair a bit as well amp though it air dries frizzy amp poofy if i don t at least scrunch it tamed it somewhat it was better than what i had hoped for it actually preforms better than my macadamia nut oil that i purchased which has that amp argan oil in it my hair apparently likes this better though it s kind of hard to get the product out without making somewhat of a mess i tipped it slightly to get some out amp it runs down the side from the opening messy but i ll deal with it not a huge issue the little package is cute though i like it this will definitely be a staple in my hair care routine if it keeps up the impressive work 
2011-08|5.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|i m using this along with the shampoo and conditioner i like this more then the other argan oils i ve tried it leaves my hair very soft and smooth and the fragrance is very very warm and soft i use a little before drying and a little after
2011-08|4.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum|first of all this product smells a maaaaaa zing so so so good that i have to stop myself from using it too much because i would end up with a greasy mess atop my noggin this is a silicone amp oil serum that is to be applied to wet hair pre blowdry i am not thrilled with the amount of silicones in this but i have been pretty anti silicone the last few years as i was trying and trying to deal with my wavy curly poofy hair with the curly girl method no cones no sulfates but i wanted to try a keratin treatment so now i am wearing my hair straight this is not too thick and doesn t leave my hair sticky it leaves it soft and smooth did i happen to mention the smell yeah that good i have never tried moroccan oil but i am willing to bet this is similar and at a fraction of the cost i would prefer that it come in a pump because i sometimes end up with too much in my hand with just the pour top other than that it s a winner 
2014-08|2.0|Moroccan smooth perfection blow out cream|i tried organix moroccan smooth perfection blow out cream for a few weeks to smooth down the cuticle unfortunately this brand is not worth the low price you may as well rub body lotion onto your hair never using it again 
2014-08|3.0|Moroccan smooth perfection blow out cream|i can genuinely say i really liked this product but sadly i can t seem to find it granted i ve only checked my local walmart but still i liked the lightweight nature of this product and i have the ability to use it as a smoothing creme after my hair is dried and straightened it really helps my hair from being frizzy and gives a little shine as well my only grip is the packaging it s pretty difficult to use up the entire product because of the bottle also i can t turn it upside down unless i corner it between three products and even still i don t find that it all migrates to the top for me to use i gave it a 3 5 because i can t find it and the fact that the packaging ins t exactly the greatest if i happen upon this product again i would definitely repurchase 
2012-08|1.0|Moroccan smooth perfection blow out cream|not a fan once again of organix products this is supposed to be a blow out cream and makes my hair dry while i am blow drying so it does the complete opposite of what i expected most blow out crèmes add moisture and allow the drying to be less damaging and faster this crème did not do the trick for me sorry made my hair feel like straw 
2012-08|2.0|Moroccan smooth perfection blow out cream|i really did not like this product the smell was great but after applying it and blow drying my hair it felt quilt quot filmy quot and just not soft i prefer redken s satinwear product its worth the extra money 
2012-08|4.0|Moroccan smooth perfection blow out cream|this product is amazing it makes my hair so soft and smooth after i blow dry it it is not too heavy an doesn t make my hair feel greasy and weighed down like some other products do it also smells really good but isn t that strong i have thin to medium hair that is usually really wavy and poofy if i let it dry natural so this product helps straighten it somewhat but my hair still has a lot of body after using it so it doesn t straighten too much i would recommend this product it is really great
2012-08|3.0|Moroccan smooth perfection blow out cream|i like the scent it s very light and fresh smelling and inoffensive i hate those overly sweet hair product scents a la garnier fructis the texture is pretty nice think a light whipped lotion not the drippy kind however on my poofy coarse asian hair this just doesn t cut it i think this product would work well with people who have fine hair and need a standard light styling cream to blow dry with on me it s not substantial enough and while it does straighten to some extent when i sue a roundbrush i ve definitely tried products out there that left my hair straighter plus side is it doesnt weigh hair down down side is my hair is the type that needs a little more weight
2014-08|3.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i remember the first time i washed my hair with this shampoo i feel in love with the way ir smelt like some real nice candy an it made my hair somewhat nice but after awhile my hair would reject it so i stopped using also another down side is i dont even think they make this anymore
2012-08|3.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|pros smells amazing beyond amazing lathers well cleans well sulfate free cons dries out my hair
2012-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|all the organix shampoos are no no for me they dry out my narturally curly hair which is also colored i am sure they will be fine for virgin hair great as body wash though if you have some shampoo you just don t want to throw out
2012-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|what drew me to this product was that it was sulfate free who wants that stuff ruining their hair not me the scent is totally intoxicating its hard to bring myself to rinse it out of my hair because it smells that good it leaves your hair soft and shiny and squeaky clean i would totally reccomend this product to anybody i m really looking forward to trying out the other quot flavors quot 
2012-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i was attracted to the cute packaging and the buzzwords on it pomegranate green tea antioxidant extracts sign me up sadly after 3 uses i found this to be the worst shampoo i may have ever tried it dried out my hair and left it coarse and unmanageable i m not even picky with shampoos choosing the cheapest when i feel cheap the expensives one when i have read enough reviews on it or drug store brands for convenience i may try another organix product in the future but definitely not this shampoo 
2012-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|smelled nice but dried out my hair so far all of the organix products i ve tried were a disappointment 
2011-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|the only good things about this shampoo is the package and the smell it is waaaay to thick builds up on my hair and makes my hair feel like straw don t waste your monie 
2011-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i have fine dry and frizz prone colour treated hair and have used the shea butter vanilla silk and coconut milk shampoos and matching conditioners with great success it is difficult and expensive to find organix in europe so i tend to buy it in bulk on line i decided to try this for a change but so far i am not impressed according to the bottle it targets dry a brittle hair but it made mine feel like straw after i washed it it was a mess of tangles after rinsing and the conditioner did very little to help the situation my hair is dull and blah so disappointed it does smell very nice fresh and fruity lovely in the morning i will probably give it away or make my husband use it o 
2011-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i ll be honest i fell for this product because of it s cute packaging after the first few uses i hated this product and hated how it made my hair feel tangled coarse and hard to manage but i stuck with it and i m so glad i did after a few more uses my hair began to feel so soft and silky i would recommended using it more than two or three times before deciding whether or not you love hate it the only bad thing about this product is the price it s quite pricey for a drugstore brand but i think it s totally worth it 
2011-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i love this product but wouldn t recommend it to people with thin dry hair however the smell is fantastic and takes care of my oily hair and doesn t mess with my highlights plus it s sulfate free which is supposedly safer for hair 
2010-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i love this shampoo i ll admit it the wonderful scent was what first convinced me to buy but i ve actually found that this stuff has been a godsend for my thick color treated oil prone hair not only does it leave my hair smelling amazing it leaves my hair soft shiny and easy to manage the fact that it is sulfate free and safe for color treated hair is another draw as well the conditioner works great on my hair type as well it is very light and moisturizes my hair without weighing it down i ve tried many shampoos but always find myself coming back to this one 
2010-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|from everyone s review it looks like this works best if you don t have fine hair i have straight ish hair that wants to be wavy and it s medium thick but i have so much hair it feels thick i ve been using this for about two weeks now along with the conditioner but i m too much of a product whore to use it every day but when i do this shampoo works really great for my hair it feels bouncy and shiny and fresh afterwards i love love love the smell it lasts all day even after i ve gone to the gym i can still smell remnants of it maybe i m not working out that hard after all reminds me of summer in these cold wintery days my only complaint is actually for the conditioner i feel like i have to use a lot of it for it to cover my hair a little does not go a long way 
2010-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|after rinsing this in the shower my hair felt so brittle and tangled that i thought my hair was straw the conditioner is absolutely no help either the smell of the shampoo smells great in the bottle but once washed through your hair it leaves a weird smell and not in a good way i wouldn t recommend this the packaging is cute and that s what sucked me in but it isn t a good product 
2010-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i tried this last spring after the lady at my salon told me to stop using pantene this did nothing for my fine hair and i still haven t used it up redken s all soft is now my favorite shampoo 
2010-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i too was drawn in by the attractive packaging and also the organic marketing also it was on sale at my local drugstore buy one get one free so i got the shampoo and the conditoner i was pretty excited to try it especially because i loved the smell after using half of both bottles though the smell is the only thing i like about this product my hair is pretty fine so i can get away with not using conditioner but after using this shampoo my hair was so tangled that i absolutely needed the conditioner so half my hair wouldn t break off when i tried to brush it out the first week my hair was dull and flat i had to combine use of this shampoo with a root volumizer which again i normally do not have to do i used this shampoo for about three weeks then switched back to the shampoo i was using before i will not buy it again 
2010-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i buy this shampoo again and again and i use it nearly every day except about once a week when i use a clarifying shampoo if i do buy a different kind of shampoo i m never as happy with it as i am with my organix pomegranate green tea i have long thick somewhat wavy hair that tends to get frizzy and sometimes difficult to manage if i m going to use a shampoo regularly i want it to clean my hair without stripping it or drying it out and i want the clean feeling to last all day so that my hair doesn t end up stringy and greasy by the end of the day or even the next morning this shampoo does that perfectly i also use a conditioner every day and i feel like this shampoo gets my hair ready to let the conditioner do its job how the shampoo works is most important to me but there are other perks here i actually like the packaging a lot the bottle fits in my hand very nicely it s easy to squeeze and i always feel like i get just about every last drop out of the bottle with no problem so there s no wasted product the scent of the shampoo is lovely sweet and fruity the consistency isn t runny buy isn t super thick either and it lathers extremely well so it s easy to spread through even my long thick hair it s also sulfate and paraben free has quot organic active ingredients quot and is supposedly not tested on animals from their website quot organix bottles are eco friendly manufactured from materials containing recycled post consumer resin all labels are printed utilizing environmental inks and compostable label film made from annually renewable resource corn not from petrochemicals quot none of that sounds bad so anyway this is definitely my favorite shampoo i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a shampoo that will get hair nice and clean without stripping or drying it 
2010-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|okay first i have chin length bob brown with blonde highlights and very thick hair i noticed the combination of having to wash every day and swimming was drying my hair out the smell is awesome but very powerful i noticed it sticks around after you blow dry for some this isn t a problem but i have a highly sensitive nose for some reason so it bothers me to wear hair spray plus perfume on top of my hair radiating pmegranite so i have to nix those other products when i use this shampoo also my hair was very tangled every after using with the conditioner too i am going to have to buy a hair de tangler spray when i combed my hair while wet i could feel it breaking for the tangles and my hair dresser told me i have very strong hair so this isn t good at all other than that the shampoo cleans well doesn t weight my hair down and lathers perfectly i have never tried this sulfate free in fact i wouldn t even have realized without coming here so now i am a little worried about the poster who said that after going sulfate free her hair responded badly to other shampoos hoope this won t be a problem for me as i am a chronic shampoo jumper 
2010-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|so when i bought this i wasn t expecting much to be honest after reading such conttroversial reviews i didn t think it was going to be too great for me however after trying it i loved this stuff after i blow dried my hair felt so soft and silky and was really shiny plus this stuff is helping me keep my red hair from fading so much but still cleans well also the smell is to die for i love everything about this it s one of the best shampoos i ve used and i ve used tons of high end products highly recommend 
2010-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|no no no this shampoo annnd conditioner tricked me p the packaging cute and everything on the label reeled me in and took my cash haha hate this stuff i was attracted to it as i am to most new shampoos lol and sadly did not love it at all it dried my hair out quite a bit i actually gave the pair a decent run of my time and they just proved to be a weak duo the conditioner did nothing to help with the drying the shampoo was causing lol the smell though amazing lt 3 i love the scent of pomegranate and green tea lifts the spirits a bit lol but i wasted my money on this somewhat pricey drugstore shampoo and conditioner i had high hopes but sadly i wouldn t dare repurchase or even finish what i have left haha not even on my mkup brushes p 
2010-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|this shampoo leaves my hair soft smooth and clean it smells terrific and the effect lasts about a day and a half i m usually someone who must wash my head every morning or my hair looks gross rinses out easily i use it sometimes without conditioner and my boyfriend with very different hair from mine short coarse blond uses it without nearly every time and i m still happy with it it s even better with though it is a little more expensive than your average drugstore shampoo and the bottle squeezes oddly it ll suck the whole dollop of shampoo right back in if you re not paying attention but overall it s really nice for my extremely thick mildly wavy frizz prone hair 
2010-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|after the first try i did not like this at all it didn t lather much or clean my hair well enough but i used it again last night amp shampooed twice and it was totally different it lathered beautifully amp my hair felt squeaky clean but not stripped it was shiny after i dried it too i guess you have to use it a couple times for it to really start working maybe it has to break through the layer of existing sulfates on your hair or something i like this shampoo a lot it smells wonderful too very similar to tbs satsuma and the scent lingers a good long time 
2010-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|terrible product one lippie for smelling great however i broke out all over my neck and behind my ears i m talking big painful pimples i thought i was imagining this so i stopped using this for one month i used it again last week and bam broke out again needless to say it went in the garbage besides this did not provide anymore moisture to my hair than other brands 
2009-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo| __reviewtextreadmorev2__ data enableyoutubepreview true data productid 119363 data reviewid 1709696 data text the smell wonderful the product drying i have normal to slightly dry hair this turned my hair to straw great smell crappy product the smell wonderful the product drying i have normal to slightly dry hair this turned my hair to straw great smell crappy product div
2009-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i bought this shampoo for two reasons 1 it was sulphate free 2 the smell i will definitely not be repurchasing this shampoo it did nothing for my hair like right after i wash it makes my hair feel too clean and then like a few hours later less than 12 hrs it feels all greasy it s kinda gross i used the coordinating conditioner and that didn t do anything either this is one of the worst shampoos i have ever used 
2009-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo| i didn t pick it up for its sulfate free or organic properties but the smell when i flipped open the cap lid i was sold it s divine no it didn t weigh down my hair but there are some hairs i want weighed down like the flyaways and baby hairs around the top of my head i also like lather this had very very little and i had to use quite a bit for my long hair when i stepped out of the shower i didn t get that quot squeaky clean quot feeling that i happen to like in my shampoos maybe that s the trade off you get for an environmentally conscious product who knows but it s not a trade off i m willing to make i grabbed this shampoo when it first came out and had a 100 mail in rebate wrapped around the cap glad i took advantage of that because i d never re purchase this shame the lingering scent is so nice 
2009-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i used the shampoo along with the conditioner which was terrible i have a lot of very fine hair cut to my shoulders the first week the results were okay my hair had decent body and shine after that first week my hair was dried out and tangled super easily with zero body and very dull like it was stripped i have not tried this shampoo with a different conditioner so i really can t say how it is on it s own but i do not recommend the shampoo plus organix pomegrantate conditioner the smell however i loved eta i finally found my hg amazing shampoo and conditioner that is sulfate free tigi bedhead superstar 
2009-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i ve used this shampoo in conjunction with the coconut milk and the results have been phenomenal my hair is left squeaky clean shiny voluminous and soft it no longer retains to a whole bunch of water after every wash nor does it take as long to dry i believe that this shampoo is responsible for a good cleaning as well as the softness and the shine while the conditioner should be credited with not weighing down my hair with a bunch of silicones and additives but as i use them together i can t really disentangle their effects in any case i do not forsee myself purchasing any other type of shampoo or conditioner in the near future will stick to organix for a while 
2009-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a week now it leaves my hair shiny and soft more so than some quot shine quot shampoos i ve tried the smell is amazing for some reason it reminds me of christmas the scent sticks around too after blowdrying and curling with a flat iron it was still very noticeable i will definitely buy this again 
2009-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|great product after doing the brazilian keratin treatment i was recommended to only use sulfate free shampoo and conditioners i came across organix and loved it my hair is shiny and smooth 
2009-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|it has a wonderful kool aid scent and doesn t strip my hair of moisture or make it frizzy my hair and scalp have experienced no build up with consecutive use i didn t really think i would like this but it works as a gentle everyday shampoo it has a good lather too i m still pondering if i should get the matching conditioner but so far it has worked well with my other conditioners i found my bottle at walgreens for about seven bucks worth a shot 
2009-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i buy this brand tried the tea tree mint scent and liked it because it s sls free and my scalp has responded well no more thick itchy scaly patches of skin on my scalp anymore i ve seen reviewers saying their bottles were runny but both of my bottles tea tree mint scent and now pomegranate green tea scent were thicker than usual shampoos somewhat gel like for an sls free shampoo it lathers just fine and to me smells like bayberry and pine i m happily reminded of christmas every time i use it d most stores i ve seen carrying this brand are priced about 6 99 per bottle but often the stores will offer a buy one get one free 
2009-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i love this shampoo i have tried several sulfate free shampoos and they just didn t leave my hair as soft as this shampoo does not only does it smell great but it leaves my hair so soft and does not strip my haircolor i also heard that shampoos with sulfates can cause acne so that is why i decided to go with sulfate free shampoos no more acne i am really happy with this shampoo i will try the other organix shampoos they all seem to smell really good oh the other thing i noticed with this shampoo is that i don t loose as much hair with other shampoos there was a lot of hair that would fall off in the shower not with this shampoo i was surprised that i did not see any hair on the floor 
2009-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|wow this stuff is awesome i ve used the tahitian vanilla and the coconut milk formulas as well and this is my favorite it cleans really really well but doesn t strip at all and leaves hair soft and shiny but not weighed down it smells awesome too i m not sure what else to say about it but like the previous poster i have no complaints whatsoever for reference i have long straight fine but plentiful hair that tends to be weighed down and dried out easily but not by this 
2009-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|i don t have a single complaint about this shampoo i love that it is sulfate free because ever since i switched to sulfate free shampoos my hair freaks out when i go back to shampoo that has those nasty chemicals in it this shampoo first of all smells phenomenal not in an artificial herbal essences kind of way and i ve found that the scent sticks around longer than it did with other organix hair products this makes my hair feel so soft and it keeps it from getting frizzy and doesn t weigh down my natural waves like a lot of hydrating shampoos do i love this 
2009-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea shampoo|this has to be the best shampoo i have ever used from the most expensive high end department store brand to the best drug store brand my hair has never been more curly or shiny i hope this is around forever and it never changes a bit it soaps up easily and never makes my hair feel dry i love it my hair is like it was when i was a kid before heat and over styling got rid of my natural curls and waves i ve always had shiny hair but never when it s wet even when it s wet it s gleaming 
2014-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Hibiscus Creamy Body Wash|the reason i picked up this body wash is because i love the typical coconut smell and this product delivers it smells absolutely amazing and makes your skin feel super soft as well it just makes your shower experience calming and you feel clean afterwards i m use to always using just dove bar soap but i think i m switching over to this this is the product description from their website quot this buttery body wash envelopes the skin in a creamy lather leaving it clean soft and touchable all over with an intense moisture lock system that uses a pca complex to help draw moisture into the skin while a ceramide complex creates a surface barrier to lock it in sugar cane and willow bark promote cellular turnover and hydrating coconut milk proteins create a healthy glow quot 
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Hibiscus Creamy Body Wash|rich and creamy lather intoxicating scent affordable price fantastic body wash 
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Hibiscus Creamy Body Wash|i love fragranced body products but since i m so sensitive and allergic i usually can t use them well i can use this everyday in the shower with no irritation and it smells awesome it s very creamy and moisturizing but leaves you feeling clean absolutely love this stuff walgreens has it buy 1 get 1 free right now great deal 
2014-08|5.0|Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum|i m surprised a lot of people mention using this product only on wet hair in their reviews i guess it works differently on everyone because of different hair types i absolutely love this product and it is my favorite serum to use as a finishing touch i have rather long straight hair which is on the drier side a bit thinner and tends to frizz quite a bit i basically use this product after i air dry my hair to tame my frizz and it works wonders it tames my frizz and leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny i use a tiny amount and rub it into my hands before applying it on my hair i prefer using this on dry hair because if i use it when my hair is still wet it doesn t tame my frizz at all also you get a lot of product for the price because i ve been using mine for almost 2 years and still haven t run out of it so i m genuinely happy with this serum 
2013-08|5.0|Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum|wow not sure whats with the negative reviews on this but this is a hg product for my hair maybe its the hair texture i love this stuff it makes my dry coarse thick long curly wavy and hard to manage hair look very soft and shiny this is best applied when your hair is wet if you apply it dry it doesn t seem to do much i apply it when it s wet and let it soak in for about 30 minutes since my hair is so picky and then dry it it comes out very smooth and sleek if i straighten it after it is very very shiny and soft anytime i use this and straighten it after my hair looks like a shampoo commercial lol not to knock anyone but i did notice these types of products are more suited for people with my hair type and you have to let it soak in less is more as well i have been using these types of products for over 15 years and this is one of the best i have used fyi if you have thin hair oily hair or normal hair i seriously would not recommend this stuff or anything in this type of product field my best friend is in that category and does not notice a difference in her hair with this stuff i hope this helps 
2013-08|2.0|Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum|this product didn t do much for me while it did make my hair shiny it didn t eliminate frizz it made my hair more poofy i didn t see much of a difference from if i let my hair dry naturally not worth the price 
2012-08|2.0|Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum|while this does make my hair very shiney the only way i can really use this is if i apply it to soaking wet hair and throw it up on a top knot it s just too greasy and too heavy for my hair type as are most quot oils quot i use it smells great though this works really great on my jamaican friend when he grows his hair out a bit it really brings out his curls and makes them look very put together and glossy i could see this working for thicker ethnic hair 
2014-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|this mousse is like no other product i ve used it is liquid in the bottle but not a spray it is called a mousse but is really a foam it smells like the rest of this line coconut but the smell doesn t linger it fades leaving only a light faint smell of the original i have used this as my only quot setting quot product for my 2c 3a hair and had good results it gives enough hold to prevent frizz but doesn t define i have fairly defined waves curls on their own but need frizz control and clumping help this rocked for that i have used on both wet and dry hair having good results both times i have also used this as second day reviver and it works well this leaves no crunch and not much residue my hair is softer smoother with other products but this has the huge benefit of not feeling like my hair is coated in product which i prefer i do wish it left my hair feeling more conditioned but it seems to neither moisturize nor dry it out which i ll take i always start my hair routine with an oil to smooth soften and seal and when using this mousse this is the only product i layer on top i do not rely on this in humidity or wind i live in the desert as it doesn t hold up overall i will purchase again to have as a light hold to revive second day hair or simply as a touch up product that won t leave crunch residue washes out well and overall is impossible to mess up on amount used as a note this works best if you shake the bittle before pumping shaking really makes it come out in a nice foam i shake a few times pump 3 4 times apply and repeat i only had issues with it being liquid before i found that shaking makes all the difference 
2012-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|if you don t have thousands of dollars to shell out to take a vacation to a tropical island this mousse will get you there with 2 of the cost just kidding no need to over exaggerate anyway i really do love this product i have type 2b curly hair and although this product isn t meant for scrunching or for having long lasting hold it smells scrumptious and leaves my hair soft and toussled to get my curly hair to the wavy toussled level though i had to use a few different products to keep the hold in if you just use this product alone it won t shape hair whatsoever this product would work best for those who have straighter relaxed hair to achieve a little bit of volume and shape as opposed to those who have thick unruly hair who want a lot of hold 
2012-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|pros smells amazing lightweight adds definition and defrizzes great for styling cons not for scrunching hair at all 
2012-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i m generally not one to repurchase hair products but i would definitely buy this one again this is an all around fantastic styling product which i imagine would work well for many different types of hair it is lightweight and non greasy but still strong enough to smooth frizzy hair while making it more brushable and easier to detangle it also makes hair shiny i don t need to use any serum or gloss afterward it provides light hold at best though so if you re looking for something that will really define and hold a style this isn t it think of it more as a product to add silkiness softness shine and manageability to hair it also has a beautiful light scent which fades fairly quickly a true winner 
2012-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|this mousse is oddly watery and produces rather mediocre results and yet i would buy it again why you ask because it smells amazing and the yummy coconut aroma lasts for hours so think of it less as a styling product and more as a hair perfume 
2012-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i love the smell and consistency of this mousse it s light and not sticky i use it in my hair when it s wet and then twist my hair around my fingers to enhance my natural curls i would recommend this mousse because it s natural and does its job well without being a sticky mess i ve also found it doesn t leave any residue the packaging is very cute too sort of like an egg it has a simplistic modern design and it is in a plastic bottle whereas most mousses i ve seen come in a can 
2012-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|finally i have found my hg hair product i bought this as i wanted the organix argan oil shampoo and there was an offer on of two products for 8 so picked this up because i love coconut scented products didn t really expect much of it but oh my i have been proven wrong i have wavy ish hair that i like to let air dry my hair is in pretty good condition although it varies on a daily basis as to how nice it looks when it dries sometimes it goes lovely and wavy curly and other times it dries with huge kinks and looks horribly messy i also have the issue that sometimes my hair can be a bit flat for years now i have been searching for that product which i can put into damp hair and then just leave my hair alone and that will give my hair that extra bit of volume i need while also making my hair go lovely and wavy and keep frizz at bay i may have been looking for a little bit too much from one product so needless to say i have gone through countless different products from sea salt sprays to leave in gels to serums but alas finally i have found just the product i have been searching for this mousse at first does not appear promising as it comes out very watery but i find that makes it easier to run through my hair evenly it makes my hair frizz free and accentuates my hair s waviness while adding body to my hair i find that it makes my hair super soft although sometimes and this is my only negative for the mousse i don t like this as it goes so soft that it gets to that unmanageable stage this stuff also smells gorgeous but sadly the scent doesn t last for long on my hair overall an amazing hair product 
2011-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i bought this product looking for a good mousse that would keep my curly from being frizzy but not make it hard i chose this because i have already tried the coconut milk anti breakage serum and that worked wonders on my hair i really like the smell of this but it comes out sort of watery and didn t do much to prevent frizz plus the bottle leaked at the store and i had to go back and get another one but it did make my hair feel soft 
2011-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i ended up using this product as a foam to reset my curls the scent of this product is nice but i could of have done the same thing with a spray bottle of water this product had very little hold factor for me as a hair mousse this is more of a product for someone who prob doesnt need a high factor of hold or doesnt like that heavy hair product feel in thier hair 
2011-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|a light mousse which helps define my wavy hair and smooth the frizzies without being stiff or sticky very nice 
2011-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|the smell of this product is great and the product it self did not weigh my hair down however it made my hair feel sticky sometimes even when air dried the texture is a bit sticky and runny also it was a good test trial with this product but i don t think i ll be purchasing it again in the future 
2011-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i am a sucker for all things natural or organic my hair thick wavy not dyed not damaged i love using this stuff it smells delightful like a beach it doesn t make your hair look wet and doesn t make it feel crunchy it is perfect overall i recommend this because it is not your typical mousse that is very strong where your hair gets hard and looks wet 
2011-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|would give this a zero if i could made my hair dry like straw frizzed out my hair and didn t define my curls at all 
2011-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i love the smell of this and i love that it feels like nothing at all what i do not like is how thin it is when you put it on no matter how much you shake it the after effects are worth it though 
2011-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i have thick medium length hair and i just love this mousse i ve used others which are heavier and they take away some of the shine and my hair lacks softness what s great about this mousse is it makes my hair feel soft and keeps the shine after my usual wash i don t like the big hair look anyway and it holds my hair enough using hot rollers on dry hair to provide a nice lift i hope this mousse never goes off the shelf 
2010-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i like this mousse a lot it smells phenomenal and it really helps define my wavy not curly hair without weighing it down it also helps control some of my friziness i did notice however that my second day seems a little more dirty than usual i m not sure if it was due to this mousse or the fact that my body was going through some major hormone issues just had a baby either way though i would still repurchase this mousse simply because i have yet to find another mousse that does not weigh my fine hair down 
2010-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|pros smells like coconuts great packaging very handy eco friendly defines curls ok better when used with another mousse makes hair soft and shiny cons doesn t hold super well 
2010-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|this mousse didn t weigh doen my hair or make it stiff but it didn t really do much else i have thick frizz prone wavy curly hair and this didn t define my curls at all i looked like a big frizz ball and my hair looked fuzzy and gross i won t repurchase ever 
2010-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|this is the 1st mousse i ever liked it does not weigh my hair down nor does it make it oily sticky or stiff it s super light smells great and lightly conditions imho opinion it does volumize i have somewhat fine wavy hair below the chin not quite shoulder length as does my daugther it s always challenging finding a styling product that lightly conditions and controls our hair w o weighing it down we had some success with the lacoupe products but i like this much better an a in my book 
2010-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|this is the absolute worst hair product i have ever used it did nothing for my frizz and made my hair even more frizzy dry i threw it in the trash after one use please do not waste your money on this product 
2009-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|original review 01 29 2010 disclaimer i ve only been using this product for a week but i ve used it several times this week this is the first time i ve really liked a mousse because i hate the scrunchy feel of most mousses this is totally different it s lightweight non scrunchy non sticky and has a great light coconut scent i used it to blow dry with a round brush and make waves with diffuser and it gave me good volume and hold even the second day after washing my hair i think it also repels dirt because my hair isn t very greasy after two days i ve found the mousse is a lot like the living proof products update 06 21 2010 after using this product for 6 months i stand by my review above i m still very pleased with this mousse i have medium long hair and i use it every other day i use about 3 5 pumps use i m still using the same bottle i reviewed back in january great value tip if your curly wavy hair looks flat after sleeping on it use a little water to revive the mousse i find that scrunching then lightly shaking out my hair brings back the curl and volume 
2009-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|if you like coconutty scents then you will love how this one smells pros made hair soft made hair shiny and bouncy cons didn t add any volume to my fine hair overall not a bad product but if you are looking to add volume this won t help you out one bit i use it when i put my hair in a ponytail because it adds shine and bounce 
2009-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|the fragrances of organix products always draw me in but so far i ve found the styling products so so i have fine wavy hair and a lot of it i used two pumps of this mousse worked it through from roots to ends and let it air dry i was pleased with the the way it brought out my wave pattern and that it left my hair soft not crunchy however i was disappointed by the complete lack of volume which i expect from a mousse if the delicious scent lingered i think i might have overlooked some of this product s weaknesses but i couldn t smell anything after an hour or so that was a real let down overall i found this product pretty lackluster there are more effective mousses out there in the same price range so i won t be repurchasing 
2009-08|4.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i bought this initially for the smell however as a mousse i think it works fine i have super fine long color treated hair and almost always let it air dry after i get out of the shower i usually spray on some rusk brilliance leave in color protector and then put some of the organix mousse in when my hair dries it definitely has more body than usual nothing crazy more like what i wish my hair would be like naturally and it smells so good the smell sticks around too if i was really picky i d probably put something on my ends to soften them slightly but overall i m happy 
2009-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|although i am very dissatisfied with organix coconut milk shampoo and conditioner i think that serum and styling products of this line are really good i use this foam on dry hair in order to give a quick fix to my bad looking hair before leaving home and it really works it s not sticky and smells nice 
2009-08|5.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|this mousse is amazing it give tons of lift and volume to my fine hair and it also eliminates static i usually need to carry a dryer sheet in my coat pocket all winter because of static but since using this product i can style and brush my hair with no static at all it is very different than any mousse i have ever used the consistency is light more like a foaming soap i love this product i can t believe the difference in my hair since using plus it smells really good 
2008-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|nope it was just blahhhh the only thing it did was weigh my hair down and make it feel sticky it did smell really good though 
2008-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|this stuff smells great and the packaging is good too as far as performance goes it worked fine to tame the frizzies in my naturally wavy hair but didn t provide a lot of lift when i straightened it it s a good basic mousse but don t expect much in terms of volume i found that it helped with manageability though 
2008-08|2.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i did not like this it smelled great i put on when my hair was wet and it felt like i had shampoo in that needed to be rinsed out i guess because of the lathering ingredient in it when my hair dried it was flat and limp i have fine hair i ended up trying to use it to shave so i wouldn t waste it and it was no good at that either threw it away 
2008-08|3.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|i actually really like this it is weighless its a mousse so it foams up slightly not as much as i like but you also don t need to use much i even let my hair air dry with this and it doesnt get crunchy but has good hold to keep my waves wavy amp non frizzy smells great big bottle i actually have a hard time with the fat bottle though makes pumping a bit hard i would re purchase but i know this will last a while 
2008-08|1.0|Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse|the only reason i threw this out instead of returning it was that i had a try me free offer on it it certainly isn t worth anything more than free no hold at all and oddly drying despite the moisturizing coconut milk foams like shampoo and one of the ingredients coco betaine is indeed found as a cleanser in many shampoos i also get weird kinky frizzies with this and it is very heavy the coconut milk and makes my hair oddly flat at the roots but the ends got very frizzy and dry 
2014-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i wanted to post a warning to anyone who has used this product and found that their eyes constantly water in july 2013 i started experiencing a clogged tear duct on my left eye my eye began to constantly tear up literally tear drops would run down my face constantly this was so bad i had to carry tissue and dab my eye all day long very embarrassing at work and social situations not only the dabbing but my make up would rub off that eye by early morning i went to three different doctors and my left eye got seriously infected twice they suspected allergies first so i one by one eliminated all my make up products i went without any eye make up but the problem persisted i had one doctor put a needle in my tear duct to push saline through to dislodge any blockage but there was no blockage my duct was so swollen on the inside it was not apparent from the outside that he had to force the tiny needle in the hole ouch the last doctor i went to was a tear duct specialist and encouraged surgery she warned that one more infection and i could loose site in my left eye so i scheduled surgery for 7 28 14 they needed to create a new tear duct for me serious surgery 1 week at home and 1 more week without any make up 2 days no work at the end of may 2 weeks ago i ran out of the pomegranate conditioner and bought another brand of hair products and suddenly my eye recovered 100 the day after i stopped using it the entire tear duct issue went away and i cancelled my surgery yesterday i have noticed that the shampoo and conditioner is no longer available in the stores and wonder if it was quietly pulled off the shelves in any case i wanted to post a warning in case anyone else wanted to try this or has these symptoms in general i like the other organix products especially the fragrance main other complaint is with their bottles you cannot sit them upside down and once they are no longer full it is difficult to get out the product 
2012-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|don t waste your money it smells nice but it won t condition your hair my hair felt like straw afterwards i liked giovanni s conditioner line better this was another dud for me 
2011-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|everyone is complaining about how this product leaves your hair dry and brittle i can tell you that it is not a conditioner for people with thick curly dry or frizzy hair because it won t do anything for you i have straight limp hair that tends to get oily less than 24 hours after i wash it i loved the smell and used up my whole bottle rotating it with other products it was hard to get used to at first and i couldn t believe that i d spent 7 on a product that did nothing so i read the instructions they say to leave the product in your hair for a few minutes i think it s 3 5 minutes after i started leaving it in for longer it conditioned and detangled my hair very well i gave the packaging a 5 because it sat upside down fine in my shower caddy and everything on it is biodegradeable and recyclable 
2011-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|ehhhhh pretty much a waste of money it smells great the bottle is really attractive but the price is way too high for what you actually get and what you get is a conditioner that does absolutely nothing for your hair when i rinse it out my hair is just as straw like and tangly as before i put conditoner on the argan leave in oil by organix is absolutely incredible but this stuff is junk also the keratin conditioner in the brown bottle is terrible i will not buy either of them again 
2010-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|like a lot of natural or organic products out there it s usually a hit or miss for me this conditioner however does work really well for me my hair feels soft fresh and shiny afterwards the smell is fantastic and the scent lasts for hours i do agree with most people here that i have to pile on the product to get results so not sure if it s a great value overall but hey it was on sale and i got the huge bottle for 2 at cvs so why not 
2010-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|does absolutely nothing for my hair it smells good yes but it leaves my hair dry i literally have to pile on at least 2 palmfuls in my hair to feel like there is any conditioner in my hair what so ever it s absolutely horrible what a waste of money 
2010-08|4.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i have no clue why i continue to buy these conditioners as none of them have done anything for my hair i guess the cute though cumbersome bottle gets to me and the smells are to die for this great smelling conditioner actually did something for my dry damaged hair most of the organix conditioners that i have tried have left my hair less conditioned than after i shampooed but this one much to my surprise conditioned my hair nicely detangled well and left it smelling fantastic the only reason that i won t rate it a five is because i had to use a ton of it to fully saturate my hair and for the price i simply cannot afford to go through two bottles in a week my hair isn t crazily long or thick at all either so people with hair types such as those should probably avoid this or buy five at one time if it is affordable for them so i am slightly disappointed that i cannot use it more often the smell is so clean and refreshing almost energizing kind of a citrus y scent with a light perfume i love it i wish i could afford to use this on a more consistent basis because i would gladly put it in my rotation but for the price it isn t worth it if it were thicker maybe as for the packaging these bottles suck yes they are adorable and aesthetically appealing but for utility purposes they are essentially worthless they cannot be tipped over because the cap is domed so getting the last 1 3rd of it out of the bottle is enraging enough to make me chuck it into the garbage only to dig it out later out of desperation they need to flatten the caps on these things my god i usually don t whine about packaging but these are ridiculous that about sums it up for me 
2010-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i bought it for the smell this product dried out my hair what a scam 
2010-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i love the smell of this but it made my hair really coarse and dry i thought it would to the exact opposite because it being sulfate free and all i actually had to mix it with a dove conditioner just to use it 
2010-08|2.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i got this conditioner because it came with a rebate so it was like i only paid about 1 50 for it i don t even think it s worth that i m giving it 2 lippies because it smells amazing and it s supposed to be natural but it is so awful for the hair it dries it out and makes it tangly and almost brittle not at all soft or smooth in any way and for something that doesn t work i think 7 original price is very expensive for a crappy product for my drugstore all natural brand i will stick with live clean i m in canada but my all time favourite would either have to be redken all soft or lacoupe i don t mind paying for something that works but this conditioner didn t do anything for me
2010-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i purchased this product because i was looking for a great smelling sulfate free alternative to what i normally use to start off with the price was a bit expensive 6 at target i wouldn t mind paying that if the product actually worked the conditioner was a watery horrible smelling atrocity that made my hair more tangled than it was before using it after drying my hair was filmy and nasty i will definitely not repurchase 
2010-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|so when i bought this i wasn t expecting much to be honest after reading such conttroversial reviews i didn t think it was going to be too great for me however after trying it i loved this stuff after i blow dried my hair felt so soft and silky and was really shiny it felt very moisturizing and even in the shower felt like silk also the smell is to die for i love everything about this it s one of the best conditioners i ve used and i ve used tons of high end products highly recommend 
2010-08|3.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i ve only used this a couple times and while it s not the best i ve used it s not terrible i like that it doesn t leave any buildup i cant stand conditioners that leave buildup i don t like having to rinse for 10 minutes just to get it all out only to find patches where there s still bits of product this one feels like it actually sinks into my hair and rinses out very cleanly it smells amazing very similar to tbs satsuma and the smell lingers i always use a separate leave in product so the fact that it s not uber moisturizing is ok with me 
2009-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i used this conditioner with the matching shampoo i tried it for a few weeks stopped then tried again for about a month i usually like to rotate my shampoos conditioners the first week or so i used this it left my hair with decent body and shine after about 1 2 weeks my hair was dry and tangled so easily i have very fine hair but a lot of hair cut just to my shoulders if i went outside with even a little wind my hair was a tangled mess it even knotted like crazy when i blow dried it i just bought redken all soft to try to restore my hair it is such a relief to have soft hair again and not limp dry straw i really don t think this conditioner would be suitable for any hair type i did love the smell though eta i finally found my hg sulfate free shampoo amp conditioner tigi bedhead superstar 
2009-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|this isn t anywhere near as natural as the brand name suggests the conditioner itself has a very lump consistency and is highly fragranced and coloured this didn t make my hair soft smooth or less frizzy in fact it dried out and matted my hair more so than most other supermarket conditioners i think this is quite a cheap quality product 
2009-08|1.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i liked the smell but i would have to agree it makes my hair really hard to comb my hair is very knotty after using conditioner won t be buying this again i dont even want to finish it and its a full bottle 
2009-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|love it i ve used the tahitian vanilla and coconut milk formulas as well and this is my favorite in both the conditioner and the shampoo this one rinses totally clean but also detangles really well and leaves hair super soft and shiny but not weighed down i have long straight hair that is fine but dense so it can get bogged down easily but not with this this combined with the shampoo gives me magazine hair you know what i mean oh and it smells grrrreat 
2009-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|i love this conditioner it isn t too thick but it still gets the job done unlike bumble and bumble aussie and biolage conditioners that i ve tried to name a few this doesn t take forever to wash out of my hair seriously i used to just stand there for so long to wait for other conditioners to wash out enough so that my hair wasn t an oil slick i use this in combination with the shampoo and both of them have made my hair so healthy i have minimal split ends although i don t heat style just an occasional flat iron run through here and there to get rid of ugly kinks and wavy hair and it doesn t weigh down my hair and i can even use it around the roots and my hair still looks clean when it dries the smell is wonderful and authentic and my hair is so shiny and healthy love it 
2009-08|5.0|pomegranate green tea conditioner|this conditioner is great i love the way it rinses easily i love the way my hair shines afterwards it absorbs easily and without heat it helps me detangle when i ve caked my hair full of gel this makes it easy for me to comb through my curl pattern has returned since using this shampoo and conditioner i almost feel like i have someone elses hair everyone should try this i love it 
2014-08|3.0|Smooth Hydration Argan Oil & Shea Butter Moisture Restore Weightless Oil|this is pretty average i favor the macadamia oil in the organix line since it is more hydrating for my dry hair but this does feel weightless and helps control frizz it has some slight smoothing abilities and provides shine there are better oils that i have tried but this is not too bad if you are looking for a basic hair oil these go on sale quite regularly so i would hold off on purchasing them full price 
2013-08|3.0|Smooth Hydration Argan Oil & Shea Butter Moisture Restore Weightless Oil|this is another serum that promises soft and smooth hair i was not impressed it did soften but my hair looked exactly the same as when i let it air dry with nothing in it i used a dime sized amount on towel dried hair and let it dry naturally i got this on sale at cvs for 4 99 plus i had a 2 coupon regular price was 8 29 
2014-08|3.0|Brazilian Keratin Therapy 14 Day Smoothing treatment| __reviewtextreadmorev2__ data enableyoutubepreview true data productid 170208 data reviewid 2637347 data text i got this product at ulta on clearance for about 3 it was too good of a day to pass up and i was looking for a new hair treatment the product burned my eyes and stung my skin a little bit so be careful with the usage the packaging could be improved by making the bottle clear so you know how much you have used since the amount you put on your hair is extremely important for this treatment i think they may discontinued it since i can no longer find the product anywhere but thats okay with me although it did help my hair stay straight and very touchable i know i can find a better product without the burning and less complicated instructions i got this product at ulta on clearance for about 3 it was too good of a day to pass up and i was looking for a new hair treatment the product burned my eyes and stung my skin a little bit so div
2014-08|2.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i ve got this dry oil as a present and because of all the positive reviews i had high hopes my hair is very fine and i need something to make my long hair less frizzy and dry and make it a bit stronger and heavier i don t blow dry or straighten my hair so maybe that is why this dry oil doesn t work for me i have tried it on wet and dry hair and it doesn t deliver the results i am searching for my hair feels as dry and frizzy as before use and becomes also a bit stiff i think because of the keratin and silicones i think the smell is too strong and the package as mentioned before is very unpractical okay it is cheap but for me it does nothing for my hair 
2013-08|3.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|pros 1 nice smell although it is not strong at all 2 not expensive 3 can use on dry hair too cons 1 weigh down my hair 2 doesn t have a pump have to pour the oil on my palm slowly 3 the effect doesn t last my hair ends become dry again after 2 3 hours regretted buying this would not repurchase because i think there are better alternatives out there 
2013-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i think i ve found my new hg serum i got this on sale ulta and was very apprehensive about my purchase as the organix brand is a major fail for me their shampoos condish turn my thick 3b hair to straw but this dry oil actually works i m happy to say the best use is for when my hair is dripping wet from the shower i coat it with a generous amount and finger comb it through my hair i m left with shiny bouncy curls that are moisturized and it s the perfect prep for other styling products or i use it alone when i m in a rush amp only have time to wash n go my only beef is the squeeze tube packaging is hard to control the amount that comes out but excess oil can be used on your legs for a nice glow a definite repurchase 
2013-08|4.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i was looking for a replacement for pureology super smooth elixir and this was recommended i have thick curly hair that i flat iron daily to keep it tame and as a smoother for dry flat ironed hair it adds a little greasy feel to my hair and does not add the softness like the pureology the smell is very very nice though however i do like it very much as heat protection for my just washed hair and i plan to use it for flat ironing from now on the flat iron glides nicely over it and it gives my hair a nice shine i like this much better than the spray on heat protection even the pureology for some reason it does not make my hair greasy when it is the first product i use perhaps when combined with other product later it doesn t mix well i am still glad i tried it and will use it it for my initial flat ironing 
2013-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|fantastic product bought this for my highlighted dry hair to give it some shine and moisture and it did just that my hairdresser told me to get the kerastase elixir but i hate spending that much on products and this does exactly the same thing for half the price will definitely be keeping this as a staple of my hair products 
2013-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|this is a terrific product i already use the macademia dry oil and love it everything from the small packaging that makes me feel like it doesn t dwarf everything else in my bathroom and is easy to store to the smell and lastly the effect on my hair the smallest dot no more than a dime rubbed between my hands and then smoothed through my hair gives me satiny soft hair with their natural wave in tact i love this stuff and i think it will take me forever to finish the bottle but all the better for it because at 7 99 at ulta i think i ve found the best mix of silicone oil hair serum 
2013-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i recently purchased this product and i love it most products won t tame frizz and smooth hair but this really works and has wonderful ingredients in it i recommend this 100 a little goes a long way and it smells great price is affordable and works great and also doesn t make your hair greasy if you put the right amount in it makes it shiny and soft 
2013-08|3.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|a little goes a long way with this product i love using a tiny amount on the tips of my hair to smooth down any split ends it helps the ends of my hair feel smoother and healthier but if i use this on a daily basis it does begin to build up and leaves my hair a little stiff a clarifying shampoo is a must when using this oil on a daily basis as it s very heavy for someone with fine thin hair 
2013-08|4.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|honestly a pretty good styling oil i use it on wet hair sometimes and it makes it really soft and smooth while this one isn t as bad as some of the other organix oils just make sure you don t use too much or it ll make your hair greasy i love the smell it really does smell like fruity floral candy price isn t bad and the bottle lasts a long time give it a try especially if you have damaged hair 
2013-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|love this stuff i stumbled upon it at walgreens on clearance 2 12 then bogo free i scored 8 bottles of this stuff my hair is thin and fine i don t like using any products but at the same time need smooth shiny hair works great 
2013-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|bought this because i looooved the regular organix moroccan oil and although i still think that oil smells better this one is way drier and makes my hair less greasy i use it after i towel dry my hair and it makes my hair so so much fuller and if i style it with heat it just looks amazing i really love it especailyl because i went on a product binge and saw that much of my hair was falling out due to my constant use of different products this has been a savior in the past two months and i m really happy with the purchase a little goes a long way too 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|my hg is organix macadamia dry styling oil but this is a close 2nd i find the macadamia slightly more moisturizing which my hair loves i have fine dry highlighted curly hair that is prone to frizz but gets weighed down easily yep it s a pain but this oil and the macadamia both kick out the frizz and dryness while making my hair really shiny i apply the oil on wet hair after washing and then a little bit before flat ironing i don t find that either oil builds up on my fine hair and it washes out easily i use this with either the macadamia or awapuhi ginger shampoo and conditioner you can get these at walgreens buy 1 get 1 free pretty often though they re worth twice the price 
2012-08|3.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|the oil is truly a quot dry quot oil most of the hair oils i have used make my hair look very oily but this one doesn t but i think it would be a lot better with a pump it gets quite messy when you have to poor it out 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i use this on dry hair for shine and texture it doesn t weigh my medium fine hair down but leaves it soft and shiny and smelling terrific this product is really affordable too i only wish it came in a pump style bottle 
2012-08|4.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|this is currently my favorite styling product i used to think chi was my hg untili found this i ve gone through a few products that i was less than thrilled with to name a few kerastase chroma thermique kiehl s silkening cream but i think i hit gold with this how i use it i towel dry my hair a bit then when it s 50 60 wet i rub a quarter sized bit through my hair and blow dry till i m 100 dry then i take a bit more and put it where i need the protection and follow up with the flat iron i m left with hair smooth as silk no fly aways unlike with chi and shiny gorgeous hair for reference i m a guy with medium longish hair highlighted i dont like all of it though the smell is very fruity not that it s a bad smell its just that it really over powers all my other styling products my shu essence and ks elixir i asked a few friends to smell my hair a few hours later and they said it smelled fruity i m not a fan of that but i guess it s not so bad another gripe i have is the packaging i hate it the bottle is obnoxious and the hole for the product to come out is dead set in the center of an oval it s hard to get it out without seeping all over the whole package maybe they should do a pump like shu or something that looks nicer i still won t take any lippies away for those points not too expensive either definitely a breath of fresh air from my 50 elixir ultime oh i almost forgot even though i wash my hair every other day i need to clarify once a week this seems to build up even if you use a shampoo nothing a clarifying shampoo can t get rid of but look out for it if you plan to use this very often update taking away a my 5 lippie rating this does make my hair feel a bit thicker maybe it s the keratin welcomed since i have fine hair but it makes my hair flat and limp at the end of the day think if i style at 6am and i m out at 1am kind of late and this doesn t reduce fly aways as well as moroccan oil did for me i ll be writing a review soon not holy grail but it s very nice the performance is amazing given the 5 dollar price tag absolutely unbeatable 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|oh my god this oil is amazing i just thought it was all hype about another silicone packed serum but no this is just amazing it makes my ends so soft right when i m straightening its unbelievable its lighter than moroccanoil so i preferred this new one theres hair keratin in the serum so it really helps with damaged ends not to mention the smell is heavenly and the packaging is to die for pink amp black are my favorite colors ps just a warning i ve seen some places charging 9 99 for this oil and i was like ummm no honey this is 3 99 at target on sale then regular price is usually 5 bucks you really get an amazing product for nothing i bout 3 so i don t run out 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|like others mentioned i bought the shampoo version and it came with a tiny sample on the back i currently use moroccan oil the actual brand name while my hair is wet i decided what the heck and tried the sample out my hair has never been softer especially when straightened never thought i would ever find any product hair or makeup that i would rave about enough to write a review but this stuff makes the list 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|best de frizzer ever i have super fine oily hair and i feel like i can use more of this than normal and it doesn t weigh my hair down or make it slick it actually makes it soft and shiny very cheap and better than the organix morocanoil line 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|this is my new favorite thing i love the way it smells and it is the best new hair care product i ve found in years i have fine dry delicate longish hair and i use a few drops about dime size on the ends of my hair and then rub any extra on the top i love it it smells fantastic tames flyaways and i think it has saved my hair from its usual summer damage i love it so much i went out and bought 2 more of the dry styling oils i like the argan oil shampoo from organix too i had tried their coconut line a few years ago and didn t care for it but i m so glad i tried this it s hg for both styling and conditioning for me 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i really like this dry oil not quite sure exactly what a dry oil is but i still like it first it smells fantastic light and summery i can get by with using very little on my bra strap length hair so this bottle is gonna last forever for me i put mine in dry hair after blow drying to tame any fly aways and to add some shine and softness to my hair i haven t tried it on wet hair yet even though i think it ll take a while to use up this product i will definitely repurchase just be aware that there are huge price differences between stores 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i bought this a while back after reading the good reviews i forgot i had it so this morning after my workout i did a blow out the last nite and didnt want to rewash it so i used this on it i didnt wash my hair in the shower and put this on right after about 10 minutes later my hair need time to tame down a bit my hair looks clean and to pretty straight i could run a flat iron over it but it looks like rain today im glad i tired this 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i recently bought the shampoo when i realized i was out of town without any p there was a sample of this oil attached to the bottle having naturally curly 3b curls i don t need to wash every day so am always trying to find a good way to maximize my 2nd day hair i decided to try this to freshen up my curls one morning so pulled hair out of it s pineapple ran a nickel sized dollop through my hands and over my hair and i was ready to go any nighttime frizzies were smoothed and hair smelled great oil didn t make my hair feel greasy either will definitely be buying this for 2nd day salvation 
2012-08|4.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i loved the organix macadamia dry oil so much that i was super excited to get this sample it smells better than the macadamia oil and works about as well i prefer the macadamia because it seems a little more hydrating and made my wavy hair look amazerrring this one though makes blowing my hair out actually enjoyable my hair looks and feels so soft and swishy and stays that way for the next two days after i wash style it the bottle is little goofy a lot of oil comes out and i always put too much but less is definitely more with this stuff it s worth trying out if you have course wavy hair 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|fantastic product i had never heard of this product before going into walgreens one day and seeing a bunch of new style product lines walgreens had a buy one get one free sale so i got this product and organix macadamia dry styling oil both for 7 99 so now on to how this product performs products with argan oil are usually my go to product but this works just as good if not better it s not the type of product that makes your hair feel soft instantly once it dries though it s perfect my hair is beyond silky smooth healthier looking and frizz free i didn t expect this product to perform so fantastically as with any serums or oils if you put too much it will get greasy this product get s an a will purchase again 
2012-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|finnnnalllllyyyyy i have found something for my horrible dry damaged hair i dye my hair often as the dye fades super fast therefore my hair is like straw in some parts after trying tons and tons of different leave ins masks oils and various treatments i didnt really think this was going to work i am happy to say i was wrong i put a little in my hair then blow dryed i felt my hair and to my suprise it was silky soft i then flat ironed it and added a little more after i was finished styling i could not stop touching my hair all the rough dry frizzy straw like pieces were now supersoft i am going this week to stock up on more so i don t run out 
2011-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|oh my gosh to say i m in love might be an understatement this gave me such beautiful hair i really really hope it s not a fluke i rubbed about a quarter sized dollop between my palms yes i know that s a lot but i have coarse hair then ran my hands through my damp hair several times then blow dried my hair was nice not quite as frizzy as usual and super soft the instructions don t say to use with a flat iron but i put more on my ends and flat ironed just to see what would happen the results were amazing my hair was sleek yet still looked full not weighed down at all i have not worn my hair down in ages because it just looked so terrible but after using this i was able to ditch my ponytail finally i was about to just chop all my hair off again but if this keeps working i may let it grow for a while if you have coarse frizzy hair give this a try because it might be just what you re looking for 
2011-08|5.0|Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil|i was walking thru my local grocery store and seen something new from organix the bottles were a metallic black with hotpink sparkles i had to look organix invented a new line shampoo conditioner styling oil and a mask in the formulation of awapuhi ginger well they only had the shampoo and conditioner and the price was steep so i wound up going to waldgreens and got it on sale i wound up trying out the styling oil i have to say i am soooooo in love with this product it makes my hair so soft and shiny and the scent is so pretty after finishing my hair i felt like i got a blowout in hawaii this organix line is so brillant and its fractions of the cost of the bigger brands its modeled after i am looking foward to trying out the matching shampoo conditioner and mask i cant wait to write the next review 
2013-08|2.0|Three Minute Miraculous Recovery Deep Conditioner|i usually only comb my hair in the shower when i have conditioner in it i was unable to run the wide tooth comb through my hair with this product in it i think i was tricked by the name and the pretty package around the time i started using this product i also started breaking out on my hairline on my neck and a few spots actually on my scalp i only use this conditioner once a week and also changed my regular conditioner so it may be that i don t believe this product is worth the money 
2013-08|3.0|Three Minute Miraculous Recovery Deep Conditioner|with a name like that this product makes some lofty claims i m not usually a sucker for such marketing gimmicks but i figured i d give it a try the product had a faint pleasant but unidentifiable sent it has a rich creamy texture but i had to use about an ounce to work through my thick long hair which seemed like a lot i used this treatment 2 3 times a week for the past 3 weeks and while my hair seems slightly shinier and softer i didn t notice much of a change in the amount of breakage or split ends which was disappointing debating whether or not i would buy it again 
2013-08|1.0|everstraight brazilian conditioner|the packaging was fine the price was very reasonable but the product did nothing for me no wait a minute it did do something it made my moderately short hair a tangled mess the wide toothed comb did not glide through my wet hair but snagged all over my head i do not see any effects with curbing the frizzes i will probably use it up but i will definitely not repurchase i have been seduced by a number of organix products but i have failed to find one that lived up to its promises very ordinary drugstore products there are much much better drugstore hair products out there 
2012-08|5.0|everstraight brazilian conditioner|combined with the everstraight shampoo my hair was soft after blowdrying and using flat iron my hair feels healthy 
2013-08|5.0|Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Hydrating Masque|i can t believe this doesn t have more reviews i m in love with this stuff i got it wanting a change from the moroccan argan oil one that is also by organix this stuff is awesome it doesn t leave any nasty build up on my hair and leaves it feeling nice and nourished but the best part the smell it smells like coconuts and literally lasts all day long i d buy it for the scent alone i adore this stuff 
2013-08|1.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|i bought this because i loved the way it smelled and there was a coupon for it it looked thick and creamy so i thought it would work especially since it is pricier than most other drugstore conditioners but this conditioner did not do its job at all i must have used half the bottle trying to get the tangles out of my hair and it still did not work and let me just say that i have fine straight hair any decent conditioner should be able to untangle fine straight hair i should have stuck to my 2 99 bottle of herbal essences nothing beats that one 
2012-08|1.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|cons smells too sickly sweet amp fruity doesn t do it s job at all not moisturizing gives my hair an icky texture i ended up using it as a shaving cream 
2012-08|5.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|this product is amazing it smells so fresh and fruity and the scent stays with you all day it takes away all of the frizz in my hair and leaves it straighter then it usually is also i use it with the matching shampoo i love it and would definatly buy it again 
2012-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|the smell of this conditioner is amazing and it softens and smooths my hair after every wash it leaves my hair sufficiently moisturized softly nourished and beautifully smooth but the thickness of the conditioner is infuriating after only using up half the damn contents i can t get any more out of the bottle ugh no matter how hard i squeeze the bottle none of the conditioner comes out if it wasn t for the thickness this would get five stars it s a good product for the price but the thickness is a real problem 
2011-08|1.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|i really wanted this to work out as it s a cruelty free somewhat greener product readily available at any drug store at a decent price this conditioner actually left my hair more tangled it did not moisturize at all the scent is ok a bit sharp for me this has turned me off from trying other organix products and will stick to my aubrey conditioners
2011-08|5.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|oh my gosh i cannot believe all the bad reviews that makes me sad because this worked very well for me my hair is very dry and this leaves it moisturized smooth and really really shiny every time i use it hg conditioner smells yummy too which is cool 
2011-08|1.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|i never bother to comment anywhere but i felt so compelled after purchasing this product to sign up for this website just to get my voice out there this product is awful i wanted to try something new i have very normal hair a bit wavy thick not coarse very normal hair i wash my hair every day so i guess if there is something wrong with my hair it could be that it is oily this product dried out my hair like nothing i ve ever felt after using the conditioner i couldn t run my fingers through my hair to save my life blow drying was a nightmare because my hair felt sticky and disgusting maybe the other versions of organix are better but this acai berry and avocado truly stick the only plus i have is that the smell is nice which does not out weigh the outcome i can feel my hair crunch as i touch it just awful enjoy 
2011-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|i bought this as a leave in conditioner on the recommendation of a friend i have to say it is actually much better as a leave in conditioner than a rinse out so i m very impressed it makes my hair quite soft and frizz free plus the smell is absolutely amazing when you start out after a few weeks worth of use it becomes very strong 
2011-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|i love the smell of this conditioner i think it works well with the organix shampo i use i use the cherry ginseng i don t have a problem using 2 different ones because i have different needs for my hair so i like that thier is a selection to choose from some complained about the price and yes i agree some stores charge a insane price but i found it at winco for 3 51 i stocked up some have complained of tangles i have very long hair and so i expect tangles even after conditioning i use a detangler focus 21 seaplasma is an amazing one and cheap and then follow through with organix renewing moroccan argan oil its a great heat protectant and it makes my hair smooth and shiny i wash and condition my hair every other day and would not change my routine for anything my hair is healthy and shiny and my husband says it feels super soft 
2011-08|2.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|i tried this with the matching shampoo and this conditioner did not measure up while the shampoo was really good with my hair i just felt like this condioner didn t do anything the scent is great but this was disappointing 
2011-08|4.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|i love this conditioner it smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft fluffy silky and smelling nice i have not used the shampoo yet but plan to soon overall this really works well for me 
2011-08|3.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|disappointed especially for the 8 price tag walgreens stuck on this i love the shampoo but this conditioner i feel like i have to use so much of it just to feel it in my hair too expensive to be using it generously though after i wash it out of my hair i can t help but feel that my hair is super dry feeling and feels tangled where did it go wrong between the amazing shampoo to this i always use my aussie 3 minute miracle conditioner after this i love the results then i ll just stick with the shampoos in this 
2010-08|1.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|this does not work my hair has never been this tangled after using a conditioner it takes me forever to brush it horrible decision buying this conditioner i wouldn t recommend it to anyone 
2010-08|3.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|this smells delicious and leaves my hair pretty soft with no tangles my hair has odd problems at the moment as i m growing out dye and going back to my natural prematurely silver hair it s fairly coarse as silver hair tends to be and dry on the dyed parts this conditioner isn t my favourite but i d consider buying it again i ve tried much worse and it really does smell great i didn t find it difficult to spread on my hair but it can take some effort to get it out of the bottle 
2010-08|1.0|Acai Berry Avocado Conditioner|i think it must be the avocado in this that makes the texture so thick it really is like smearing your hair with avocado and that said while my hair rinsed clean it felt heavy and weighted down i would say that this conditioner is best for girls with problem hair thick coarse hair that needs something really quite heavy for moisturizing this just weighed me down would like to swap it 
2013-08|5.0|Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shine Spray|asian wavy hair here this spray does what it promised i normally curl my hair with flat iron to give it some volume and i finished the look with this spray i m a sucker for shine mist product and i have tried lots of them but so far i have found my fav this spray give me my flat iron curled hair such a shining bouncing curl without looking greasy it also doesn t weight down my curl and the next day my curl still look perfect it smells good too please don t stop this product 
2012-08|5.0|nourishing coconut milk and hibiscus blossom creamy body lotion|this stuff is fantastic i already own the argan oil body lotion from the same line and love it so when i saw these on sale i snatched up the this scent as well i was a little worried this would have that fake cheap and overwhelming coconut scent a lot of products use but this stuff smells wonderful more subtle and complex than other coconut scented products you can purchase in a drug store the scent is softer than the argan scent so i believe it will work better when i wear perfume because it won t vie for attention with it it also works wonderfully i smooth this on and my skin soaks it up and feels instantly smooth and moisturized but not greasy at all there is the most subtle of subtle shimmer to it i believe the argan has a bit more shimmer than this scent but neither has very much i hope this was not on sale because its being discontinued because this is my new favorite lotion and body wash 
2012-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|this product was pretty much useless as a conditioner it did little to nothing for my hair and for all its promises and it s price i expected a lot more its only good quality was its heavenly scent which was pretty enjoyable it smells all vanilla ey and reminded me of cookies and cake batter which was divine but unfortunately the smell faded pretty quickly once my hair dried 
2012-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i like the packaging and the smell is amazing however that is about all that is good about this hair care line each and every time i washed my hair with this it came out dry and brittle also very expensive for a drug store product 
2011-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|this was the worst conditioner i ever bought it made my hair like dry brittle straw i hated it and the smell was like a vanilla cake which is good and bad i would tell everyone fo not buy this you will regret it especially if you need moisture 
2010-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|what is wrong with this conditioner i have been using the jf blonde line for many years but sometimes i buy others to mix with jf s conditioner i tried this alone and keep in mind i have very manageable straight hair my hair was like a bunch of strands that never seen conditioner it was unmanageable sticky coated and overall looked like hell no matter how much you use it just does not work never again 
2010-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|terrible conditioner for the price i paid i have short hair that s pretty easy to deal with and most hair products work pretty much the same for me but this is a total let down despite the fact that it smells awesome it just doesn t do what a conditioner s suppose to do i would apply this like any other conditioner and when it s time to wash it off it feels like the conditioner s all gone the tangles are still there and my hair actually feels a little oily not silky as it promised at all right now i m just trying to use it up with its matching shampoo i d say if you are like me and only intrigued by the scent just go for the shampoo and skip the awful conditioner 
2010-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i m totally torn on this i ve been using it periodically over the last few years and i absolutely adore the smell sort of a vanilla buttercream like cake frosting every boy i ve dated commented on how my hair smells after using this one ex said it reminded him of count chocula cereal another of whiskey in a positive way unfortunately its conditioning properties are pretty lackluster it s pretty cheap but because i have to use so much to feel properly conditioned i wind up motoring through a bottle very quickly and i have to supplement with a deep conditioner a few times a week i ve scoured the stores and the internet and have yet to find a conditioner that approximates the smell of this since they came out with the shine serum i ve been using that to supplement my hair smell instead of the conditioner so that kind of works 
2010-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|like others have mentioned this smells delicious which is what initially drew me to it as well as the claims of creating silky hair but really did very little to actually improve the condition of my hair and or mask the problems that it has my hair is very very damaged but i have honestly bought conditioners for one dollar used generally for co washing that have left my hair feeling better i wanted to like it but could not i tried to like it i tried leaving it in for one minute five minutes twenty minutes using it twice or three times within one shower etc and nothing made this stuff work as it claimed it would oh and the bottle design is repugnant as well it s also kinda difficult to coax this stuff from the bottle would not recommend 
2010-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i really like the smell it s gentle and doesn t irritate my skin it s cruelty free reasonably priced and the little squeeze bottle is cute however the product does tend to build up over time it is also hard to get the last of it out of the bottle so i have to add water and shake it well 
2010-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|sure this smells absolutely divine in the bottle which is what sucked me in beyond that it is horrid after 3 washes it has turned my hair into a lank greasy mess at 15au it is ridiculously expensive save your money and look elsewhere 
2009-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i m just amazed that there are people who imagine that this stuff smells good i find it toxic smelling it literally gives me a headache lt p gt and for the people raving about the natural ingredients have you ever looked at what s in this stuff ingredients di water aqua cetyl alcohol behentrimonium cetearyl alcohol cetearyl glucoside glyceryl stearate glycerin cyclomethicone dimethicone jojoba oil panthenol silk amino complex vanilla bean oil organic shea butter tocopheryl acetate vitamin e tetrasodium edta fragrance dmdm hydantoin methylchloroisothiazolinone methylisothiazolinone lt p gt finally i bought it because it says it s good for color treated hair and that it seals the hair s cuticles ay yi yi am i a sucker far from protecting the color it seems to be stripping it my hair is like straw lt p gt stay away 
2009-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|smells great but the smell doesn t stay and it leaves my hair rather dry too bad i m crazy about vanilla 
2009-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i love the organix vanilla silk line vanilla is my favorite scent and i love being able to use a shampoo and conditioner that complements my body lotions and perfume i originally bought this along with the shampoo because i was looking for a sulfate free shampoo i chose this one in particular because it smelled divine it distributes evenly on my hair and rinses out without problem this conditioner leaves my hair nice and soft the vanilla silk conditioner is creamy and soft with a very smooth texture it comes out of the bottle rather easily unlike some conditioners that stick to the bottom of the bottle like tacky glue while the packaging is nice to look at it s not very functional the tops of the bottles are round so when i get close to the end i can t stand the containers upside down i ve tried building little forts from beauty products to keep the bottles standing on their heads but at some point it all topples over this means getting the last of the product out is more difficult than it should be but with much shaking and bottle slamming it is possible i am on my second or third bottle now i ll continue to buy organix vanilla silk forever i think i would literally die if this was ever discontinued 
2009-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|so i was silly and bought this product because it smelt nice before reading any reviews i have found it totally unusable as a regular conditioner as it makes my hair very tangled and dry much worse than it is when i don t use conditioner at all it s truly awful and something i have never experienced in a conditioner before to avoid rendering this product a total waste of money i have been using it every now and then before shampooing on the mid lengths of my hair hoping it will provide some nourishment i then shampoo and condition my hair with another conditioner another thing i should note is that the scent does not linger after the hair has been rinsed i will not repurchase 
2009-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i like this conditioner but it s not one of my favorites it smells great and kept my hair silky and soft i do not use it with the matching shampoo which i did not like very much i don t have any problems with tangled hair like other reviewers have mentioned i apply in the shower after shampooing let it sit for several minutes then rinse however the packaging isn t that great it can be difficult to get out the conditioner after several uses plus it doesn t last very long too bad you can t turn it upside down i will continue to repurchase this anyway because i like how my hair is with it edit 2 5 2011 i can no longer find it locally in the vanilla scent which makes me quite sad some of the other scents smell nice but they don t seem to work the same in my hair mostly i miss the heavenly vanilla scent from this conditioner 
2009-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i liked this product it smells really good makes my hair soft but it has a ton of protein in it so i only use it once every other week or it will turn my hair to straw 
2009-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i wanted to like this i really did i chose this because they do not test on animals i ve been slowly making the switch as my old products ran out previously i used aussie but i missed the memo that they were bought out by procter amp gamble the smell of this is heavenly it s just amazing i read reviews on here first so i knew not to expect any slip but to still give it a fair shot my main issue with this is how tangled my hair was every time i got out of the shower i have just past shoulder length curly wavy hair i m not a baby about tangles either but this conditioner made me have to go out and by a separate detangler i could not get a comb through my hair without getting a massive headache i don t think everyone would have this experience because having curly hair has a lot to do with it but it killed it for me aside from that nothing about this amazing you do have to leave it in for the required time it didn t really have any affect on my hair same level of frizz same texture overall just very blah but for the price i think i can find better 
2009-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i usually use horse shampoo for my hair try it but after buying a whole bath skin care set scented of vanilla i decided to get a vanilla scented shampoo and conditioner as well cos i m completely anal like that what a waste of money yeah it smells great but the smell doesn t stay after you wash it and it didn t really do much for my hair i m just using it until it runs out so i could go back to my tried and true product 
2009-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i tried this product because there was a quot free with rebate quot offer the scent is excellent but that is all this product has going for it it did not absorb well into my hair it did nothing as far as detangling and my hair did not feel smooth and silky as it usually does when i use a good conditioner i m glad there is a rebate so i don t feel like i wasted my money 
2009-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i love the smell i wish is was a little more moisturizing i doesnt leave my hair dry or not conditioned i would just prefer a richer conditioner the smell is great though and it does stay a bit the next day when i was walking around outside and the wind kicked my hair into my face and it smelled like lovely vanilla 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|read organix shampoo review again love this line everything about it the absolute best product for naturally curly coarse color treated hair love this stuff 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i liked the coconut series so i decided to give the vanilla a whirl i m glad i did i love the smell and it works really really well you do need to leave it in for the 3 5 mins they recommend if you aren t getting a good result try following the directions don t expect this to work instantly like a lot of them do it needs to sit so that the oils and proteins have a moment to sink into your hair that said it makes my hair pretty easy to brush through and leaves it super soft and shiny like silk it also leaves me totally frizz free even on rainy days i ve gotten tons of compliments on my hair while using organix both versions i love this stuff and for the price it can t be beaten i used to use biolage which i also love but this is just as good and much cheaper it also has less weird ingredients than 99 of the stuff on the market 
2008-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|this product is horrible it left my long thick hair dry lifeless and a tangled mess i do not recommend the only plus was a pleasant smell but that is not what i care about in a conditioner 
2008-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|this is way way better than the coconut conditioner i wont be buying that again that said these conditioners dont do miracles for my hair which is pretty easy to control as hair goes lol it could be worse but the main thing that is so awesome about this brand is that i have discovered i can rock my hair wavy from the shower using this conditioner alone before my hair would be gorgeous for 15 minutes lol then poof now i apply this condiitoner in the shower comb thru rinse and reapply or just comb thru with a wide tooth and let dry depending on how im feeling havent noticed a difference in the effects the combing the conditioner thru is the most important part if you dont do it ladies trust me that makes a big difference so anyways yea the smell is okay i personally find herbal essences better its funny how the cheap stuff smells way better than the more expensive hair products and im a love the smell kinda girl but this one when i rinse does make my hair silky the coconut one was not a success at that il be repurchasing this and will def keep one on hand for days i feel curly but i doubt it will ever be the only conditioner i ever use it is good at str8 styling as well but i dont feel like it is as good as the expensive brands i tend to use 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i love this shampoo and conditioner set i have been using it for 6 months now with my curly frizzy hair sometimes i straighten my hair sometimes i leave it curly i use this conditioner pretty often almost every time i wash my hair when i do my hair curly i use at least a dollar coin amount and i squish it into my hair working my way up then i gently comb my hair using my fingers only i lightly swipe my hands over the roots of my hair to combat the frizz and then i leave the conditioner on for at least 5 minutes my hair always rinses silky and no frizz maybe some of the other reviewers did not leave on this product long enough or did not put enough conditioner in their hair i definitely recommend this vanilla silk line 
2008-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i keep trying these since they smell so great in the bottle but they aren t miracles this one is far superior to the tea tree and mint conditioner however the smell is cake like but not overly sweet i generally use it with the organix coconut shampoo for a dessertish shower experience it s pretty silky to apply but it s seems to rinse too cleanly leaving my hair without enough slip however my hair dries and styles pretty well after this though i might need something heavier to weigh it down i have two tons of hair of fine hair but since ever since i cut it to jaw length i need something to weigh and smooth the top layer down vidal sassoon style 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|smells amazing everything i ve tried from organix smells so yummy it leaves my hair nice and soft 
2008-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|the smell of this shampoo conditioner is awesome but the conditioner does nothing to make my hair quot soft and silky quot as it claims to in fact my hair is like a tangled mess when i try to comb through it after towel drying i always use a wide tooth comb in the shower to distribute the product evenly but even after doing that my hair was tangled and felt very dry after i got out of the shower i ve tried it several times now and my hair is totally dried out and looks damaged usually after using a conditioner my hair feels slick and is very easy to comb through i wanted to like this but it s unfortunately going into the recycle bin 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i don t know how anyone could say anything bad about this product it s the best conditioner ever i have extremely dry frizzy curly damaged hair and this stuff makes it feel like silk i don t even have to deep condition anymore i love how the smell stays with you all day long as well i looooove this stuff 
2008-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|this smells like the shampoo which i liken to carnation instant breakfast french vanilla it tends to build up in my hair and weigh it down no repurchase for me 
2008-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|so it smells awesome like vanilla frosting until you rinse it outta your hair then its gone and your left with tangles and frizz i left it in for atleast 3 minutes this will give you a bad hair day organic products suck what s the point anyway 
2008-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|i used this with the matching shampoo and it didn t really do anything for my dry hair my hair was really hard to detangle and i could hardly get a brush through it when it was time to blow dry it smells nice but not nearly moisturizing enough for me 
2007-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|update i love the smell of this conditioner but sadly after a year of using it i am going to have to stop i will continue using the shampoo because i like that it doesn t contain sodium chloride sodium chloride in shampoo makes my hairline break out which is hard to find if you know of any please message me but the conditioner does not and i mean does not detangle my hair and i am tired of trying to comb through it forever after using this stuff sad but true folks 
2007-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|since i got this free target with a rebate coupon who could resist not bad for a drugstore brand but the cones could build up quickly so prob won t use this on a regular basis eta terrible static after using this demoted to one lippie and wouldn t buy again 
2007-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|transforms hair into feeling like silk 
2007-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner|the smell is like heaven it s like baking a cake it s a great conditioner for removing any tangles that shampoo can leave behind the things i don t like about it when my hair is dried it s more frizzy than normal this surprised me since the formula is so thick but it doesn t work to prevent flyaway i also don t like that it seemed to cause a lot of build up and my hair felt greasy after using this several times this has become a conditioner that i use occasionally my boyfriend loves the way it smells so i ll use it if he s over but that s pretty much it 
2012-08|5.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|this serum is the bomb dot com i find it hilarious that it has such low reviews but i feel bad for the product s rep because the main ones reviewing it are people whose hair was not ideal for this serum i m talking to you fine haired straight haired ladies and gents now my hair is the furthest from fine and the furthest from straight that there is so this stuff is perfect i use it before a blow dry and then use a little more before i flat iron brushing it through my hair with my denman and working section by section it smells wonderful it leaves my hair feeling silky smooth helps detangle and adds shine while legit holding down the frizz it has me whipping my hair back and forth like i m in a loreal commercial this serum is cheap at 5 99 before tax and you don t need much i have never been able to get away with quot dime sized quot amounts of any product in my life until this so it lasts a while i highly recommend it for my fellow curly kinky thick haired ladies but for those with finer hair textures i d advise you to pass on this because it really can weigh hair down it is my favorite serum of all time though and i definitely plan on repurchasing 
2012-08|3.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|this smells yummy and does make the hair soft but i think it s just too much for my fine hair i need more of a quot mist quot type of oil serum i guess even used just on the ends it is a little heavy for finer hair but i think it would be great if you have super thick or porous ends 
2012-08|4.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|i bought this serum only because it is organic and is sulfate paraben free i use it religiously whenever i straighten my hair and it does a good job in making my hair smooth i just wish this serum protects my hair from heat styling tools though but nonetheless it s great d
2012-08|2.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|this was very sticky and did not do much for frizz or smoothing it did smell yummy but there are better drugstore products i think i will try the coconut serum from this brand next 
2012-08|3.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|to be honest i had high hopes for this product i mean it s vanilla silk the name of it is like screaming nourishing every strand giving soft silky hair for the product itself i d rate it a 7 10 it s not the best but then again it did help a little for my damaged ends on the ultimate plus side the packaging allows you to lock the pump handy for travelling plus it s smells really good i usually apply it after washing up at night when the hair is slightly damp and when i wake up the next morning i have this lingering vanilla scent in my hair the scent is definitely the selling point i wouldn t repurchase this though because i could get like coconut oil which is 10 times cheaper but works 10 times better 
2010-08|5.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|i ve been using this product for a year now and i am loving it it took a few tries to get the timing and amount of product i need just right but once i did it was so worth it i used to keep my hair up all day every day in an elastic and that in combination with a hormonal imbalance led to very weak dry broken hair you could see a line of breakage where i wore the elastics once i noticed i stopped wearing my hair in elastics all the time and looked for something to help repair it i chose this product because it smelled fantastic and had a rebate available i m very glad i did choose it within a month of use i was getting comments from my family that my hair looked better and healthier i have never felt my hair softer than when this product is in it on days when i don t wear it my hair is still noticeably softer but not as soft my hair is long close to mid back and i use a pump and a half when my hair is about 1 2 way dry i always always always air dry my hair and i wonder if this product doesn t work best that way since i mastered the amount i need in my hair i have had no problems with it looking greasy and there s no buildup this is a terrific product i will definitely be keeping this around 
2010-08|5.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|my mom gave me this because she got it for free but didn t need it i love it it smells nice but the best part is how shiny and healthy my hair looks when i use it i have very damaged hair due to bleaching but now i m trying to give it a little tlc by not dying it anymore or using much heated styling tools that being said styling products are a must for me if i want my hair to appear put together who likes frizz i don t and this gets rid of it pretty well it also doesn t break me out which is vital 
2010-08|5.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|i do not think people know how to use these serums correctly i have used the coconut milk an the vanilla silk the vanilla being my favorite it is best if you do have atlesat medium thickness to your hair your hair needs to be more than damp though not soaking when you apply this i used 3 4 pumps for hair that is thick and just past my shoulder blades you never should apply it past the bottom of your ears otherwise it will look too greasy then it needs to be spread evently through out and then combed through a couple times while you let it air dry which makes my thick coarse hair look like it was blown out all soft and frizz free the smell is very strong and people around you often think they smell cupcakes it thinks its decadent and very effective if used correctly also if you twist your hair while its wet it dries even more nicely with this product
2010-08|2.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|have to agree with akathisia s comment that organix s strength is their fragrance rather than performance i d say invest in a bottle of sweet almond oil which is cheaper lasts longer and has loads of different uses to it than in this stuff did not help my hair which was dry frizzy and battered from the winter didn t make my hair greasy because i have a very very full head of hair so a pump of this distributed throughout all my hair is really spread out but could easily see it being greasy on other women s hair will say this for it it does work as a mild detangler and does have a very nice scent 
2009-08|1.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|i have to agree with much of the review below except that this has put me off organix as i bought a conditioner with this too and was quite unimpressed this serum was highly fragranced and didn t do anything to make my hair smoother less frizzy or easier to manage it just sat on top of my hair making it look oily rather giving it a healthy shine 
2009-08|2.0|Vanilla Silk Serum|it seems to me that the organix line s strength is the fragrance of the products rather than the performance silk serum smells great and application is easy enough pump out a bit and evenly distribute it through the length of the hair i get greasy roots so i only applied the serum to the bottom 3 4 of my hair besides a bit of a film i didn t notice any immmediate change the label claims detangling powers but my comb didn t go through any easier than usual i let my hair dry naturally and the result was well there wasn t much of one my hair looked a little limp was no shinier than usual and felt no softer silkier it did smell lovely though i suppose this will come across as a pretty negative review but really vanilla silk serum was just quot blah quot for me not downright bad i won t buy it again but i won t swear off the whole line either 
2012-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i love the smell of this and the conditioner i like the idea of sulfate free products but this caused me to break out all along my hair line in the front and the back of my neck took about a week to go away it also made my head pretty itchy even my husband noticed while we were standing somewhere and could see all the bumps i will never use again 
2011-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|this shampoo is wonderful i don t always shampoo and you can feel the difference even in shower it makes your hair feel lighter and the smell is perfect 
2011-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|love this shampoo amp conditioner i have long fine hair that i regularly color and this product has done wonders having fine hair i find that almost any shampoo conditioner will weigh it down and cause excessive oil this product combination leaves my hair extremely soft reduces my time spent blowdrying adds weightless life and smells wonderful i add a few drops of vanilla scented oil to each bottle though as i find the scent does not seem to linger on it s own while my hair is not quot comb through quot ready right out of the shower i dont have any problems detangling before styling and my hair seems to appreciate the absence of heavy silicones anyway i would def recommend this product however it is not easy to find when you do come across it make sure to stock up am currently searching for the vanilla silk serum 
2011-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i ve used almost every hair care product under the sun from the priciest salon and designer brands to tressemme sp and everything in between i have shoulder length blonde hair with highlights very thick and tons of it because i lighten i need a shampoo conditioner product that moisturizes without weighing down my hair as far as drugstore brands go i have found organix to offer the best quality at the price point for my hair and i love the fragrance of this one but apparently so does everyone else in the new orleans area or maybe no one else does because i have only been able to locate this particular scent 2x in the past year so while i prefer the vanilla i am currently using the coconut shampoo and conditioner which also leaves my hair smelling lovely and amazing along with the argon oil repair mask and oil treatment great combo for my hair i airdry and my hair is sleek shiny delicious smelling with a bit of wave at this price the only thing more i could ask is that the stores in my area stock up on the vanilla already will continue to purchase i alternate this with wen lavender i use the wen 1 2x a week with the argon repair mask because sometimes i just have to have the classic shampoo experience 
2010-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i m pretty sure the vanilla shampoo was the one i had so i ll just review organix shampoo in general hear not that great it smells good but that s all i remember liking about it 
2010-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i absolutely loved the smell and for the short time i used it my hair did seem stronger at the roots but it was drying and made even my short medium fine thick hair feel tangled right now the best sls cruelty free shampoo i ve used is down under naturals nudes invigorating shampoo cleans hair very well without overdrying important as my hair scalp can get either too dry or oily clogged very easily and lathers almost as well as shampoos with sls while needing to use very little to do so it s also doesn t strip my semi permanent hair dye even some sls free shampoos can especially ones with lemon or very harsh citrus or drying essential oils and is very cheap for the kind of shampoo it is if you can find it in canada it s sold at sobey s and lawtons for 5 they also make a volumizing clarifying shampoo that works really well without too much drying and a moisturizing shampoo that doesn t seem to clean as well but is very gentle and actually moisturizing and all of their products smell good though not as absolutely delicious as organix actually down under naturals has the same parent company as live clean i haven t tried them yet but maybe they work similarly and i believe they re available in the us now too edit 1 19 11 i ve tried the live clean green earth invigorating shampoo that seems to clean very well without stripping the hair and has an amazing lather and feel very similar to the down under naturals nudes invigorating shampoo i ve been using though that lacks dye and is has a bit more of a natural scent and the fresh water moisturizing conditioner and leave in conditioner i really like the leave in it leaves my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down or making it feel waxy but doesn t seem to really help too much with frizz that i can see i also think i ll give organix another shot after reading that a lot of people simply needed to use conditioner to detangle after using this because of the egg protein in it i ve read that protein can really dry out hair if it s not balanced with moisturizer after reading up on hair thickening products and it was nice having my hair smell like vanilla cupcakes i ll update after trying this out again 
2010-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i was intrigued by the yummy scent and picked both the shampoo and conditioner from walmart i love the shampoo but the conditioner is another story i have short hair so my hair is pretty easy to deal with and it doesn t have any special needs either all i ask for in a shampoo is to cleanse my hair and scalp without making it a tangled mess this meets my needs and it makes hair washing a treat because it smells so so good 
2010-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|ever just stood there and a girl comes running in your direction with towel dried hair right when she passes her shampoo smells amazing right well with this shampoo you ll get that result every time it smells like vanilla cupcakes i love it it s pricey for just shampoo alone but it s worth it if you scrub really well your hair will be perfumed for the next two days if you let the conditioner set in for about 5 minutes it ll give you a more lasting result the smell is the strongest when you let it air dry it s perfect if you re going out later that night you ll still smell fresh 
2009-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla|smells awesome but isn t worth the extra money you re paying for something that s full of chemicals just like typical drugstore brands this also left my hair very dry which is odd because i bought it solely because it didn t contain any sulfates which are very harsh detergents i avoid but are found in most shampoos and clothing and dish detergent smells good but i won t repurchase 
2009-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|my hair i have medium long hair that is layered with a very slight wave i wash my hair every other day so as to not strip it of it s vital moisture i also rarely blow dry my hair and never straighten it have only used a flat iron about five times in my entire life my hair has never been dyed or permed in any way the product i used this product for a good six months until my bottle ran out i believe i was on the third bottle at the time when i went to the local wal mart and target it was not in stock but the other scents were i was not happy with the other scents so i switched to another brand shampoo after using the new shampoo for a few months i realized that it may have been a cause of my worsening acne so i wanted to switch back to something a little more natural i went to the local target in my school s town and bought this shampoo again best idea ever i ve been using it right around three weeks and combined with my organic black soap and unrefined shea butter purchased from http www hosiaonline com my acne has been getting increasingly better also this shampoo left my hair soft and smelling really good when used with the matching conditioner and a little bit of garnier fructis style sleek amp shine anti humidity smoothing milk to finish the style bottom line i recommend giving this brand a try especially if you have acne or want to begin switching to a little more natural products don t expect a miracle but if you go in with the right mindset that this won t make your hair more perfect than anything else you ll end up loving this brand p s it s easiest to find at target but wal mart also carries some of the line 
2009-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i really wanted to love this i love the smell of coconuts and it smells heavenly i noticed after awhile though that my hair got really oily and stringy i went and got my hair done at a salon in soho and the lady told me it wasn t getting the job done they had to shampoo my hair twice to get my hair clean and to get the coating completely off i use the shampoo from time to time as i have a huge bottle from bj s but don t buy it 
2009-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla|have to admit i was a sucker for the packaging thinking how classy and luxurious it would look against my black and gold italian marble tiling in my bathroom alas for me that is where it ended having oily hair which has never been coloured virgin hair i found it was ordinary it didn t feel like it gave my hair any extra body or life it pretty much ceased to exist in it s effect on my hair once it was suds at the bottom of the shower my boyfriend inherits any products i get bored with or am not crazy about like backups if he runs out and we haven t topped up his usual shampoo conditioner so this shampoo and conditioner ended up sitting in his shower after only using this product 3 times it has since run out and the bottles are on my shelf back in my bathroom with shower gel in them resourceful 
2009-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i had been using dhc s scalp cleansing shampoo but with cooler weather had been noticing my hair had been getting straw like even though i had made a point of not washing it everyday so figured this was a good time to finally try a sulfate free shampoo for me this product works great cleans my hair though i did have to get used to the lesser lather my hair is very smooth and i often forego conditioner with this shampoo i do not use this every day to avoid stripping my hair and scalp however in the summer time i might consider trying their tea tree oil shampoo if i m more oily from hot weather on a more frivolous note totally love the smell the one downside is the price in relation to the amount of product you get fortunately it s lasting for a decent amount of time because i m not shampooing every day but i do have shoulder length hair so i do require a fair amount of product it s not just organix that i ve noticed this problem with price and amount offered it seems like all the sulfate free shampoos out there are either a on the pricey side or b offer a reasonable price like organix but not generous with the amount offered per unit so will stick with this shampoo but wish they offered more product per unit update changed the rating from a four to a two and will not buy again while my hair wasn t straw like with the onset of winter by mid to late winter this stuff had my hair very straw like and frizzy found my husband s sulfate laden head and shoulders is actually gentler than this stuff don t be fooled by the pretty scent actually think organix would probably do a better job as a fragrance company than a hair care company 
2009-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i love the organix vanilla silk line vanilla is my favorite scent and i love being able to use a shampoo and conditioner that complements my body lotions and perfume i originally bought this because i was looking for a sulfate free shampoo i chose this one in particular because it smelled yummy i ve never had any problems with this shampoo my hair is thick and oily and this doesn t strip my hair or leave it feeling greasy while the packaging is nice to look at it s not very functional the tops of the bottles are round so when i get close to the end i can t stand the containers upside down i ve tried building little forts from beauty products to keep the bottles standing on their heads but at some point it all topples over this means getting the last of the product out is more difficult than it should be but with much shaking and bottle slamming it is possible i am on my second or third bottle now i ll continue to buy organix vanilla silk forever i think i would literally die if this was ever discontinued 
2009-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i bought this shampoo reading the good reviews about it and i must say i was unhappy with the results i have dry curly shoulder length hair and this shampoo did no good to my hair it made my hair dry in the first place even in the shower as soon as i used it i could feel it that my hair was not moinsturized as mentioned on the bottle the smell is indeed good but nothing else to it also you need a lot of it to get a good lather thats again a negative i would say overall i would not recomment this product to anyone 
2009-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i have dry coarse wavyish frizz prone hair what i wanted soft wavy shiny hair this shampoo is worth the 6 99 i don t like the conditioner however i just use brilliant burnette conditioner along with this this shampoo leaves my hair less porous more shiny and frizz free not a miracle but better than any shampoo i ve tried lately i digg it plus no bad chemicals all natural ingredients if you striaight iron your hair like me it looks super shiny and i think shampoo blocks humidity also is a good claryifying shampoo 
2009-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i bought the vanilla silk hair serum and i loveeee it it smells really nice makes my hair soft and best of all it had a try me free tag so i got the money back after a mir love it and ill def get it again 
2009-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i really like this stuff the vanilla is sweet and lingers in your hair after bathing it probably would not work for fine or greasy hair but for thick dry hair this stuff is wonderful i mix mine with a little water since it is very thick and hard to work into my hair good lather good cleansing without stripping 
2009-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla|love the smell dont like the performance i wish i felt it cleaned well and made my hair feel nourished but i really couldnt wait to switch to something else so the sham and cond will go back to the store 
2009-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|love the smell cleans nicely doesn t leave buildup residue not so great for detangling though definitely will repurchase 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i love love love this stuff the shampoo and conditioner both are fabulous i have very coarse naturally curly color treated hair my hair has never felt so soft i use mousse and nexxus artistic design lotion which gives my hair a bit of crunch however this shampoo and conditioner have really made a difference the sulfate free is what got me and now i am hooked the smell others talked about i am a vanilla freak and have only found it to be wonderful once you dry your hair the smell is pretty much gone unless you use no other products in your hair at 6 99 each the price isn t a bargain but certainly not what you would pay for a salon item yet this is absolutely worth every dime 
2008-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i hate to say this but this was terrible on my hair this made my hair rough dry straw like and completely unmanageable albeit heavenly smelling even though i used the conditioner religiously i wanted so much to like this product but it seemed to actively damage my otherwise healthy hair i can t use this anymore 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|this awesome smelling shampoo will leave fine thick hair like mine smooth and shiny without being greasy at the end of the day this shampoo also does not strip your hair plus its organic cant complain about this product at all 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i have the coconut milk shampoo conditioner and really liked that so i decided to try out the vanilla since it had gotten even better reviews it smells great and lathers beautifully rinses nice and clean and never makes my scalp itchy or dry thanks to the lack of nasty sulfates my hair is super soft and shiny when i use this with no flyaways or frizz even on rainy days i have gotten several compliments from people to the effect of quot wow your hair is so shiny quot overall i love it the bottle could be a little easier to squeeze product out of but that s a minor gripe considering what s inside 
2008-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla|it had a fake silicone feel 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i absolutely love this stuff it has saved my hairs life i was using artec smoothing shampoo until suddenly loreal bought it and it no longer worked good also i won t use their products first and foremost because of their animal testing additionally one time i was using their loreal vive and my hair became very weak artec was fabulous and this vanilla silk has brought my hair back to life its bouncing and alive again also they do not test on animals i am finding companies that care about animals also care about humans with the ingredients they use 
2008-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i was very disappointed in this shampoo it left my hair feeling stripped and fragile even though it is sulfate free the smell is yummy though i returned it to the store 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i saw this product at the drugstore and was tempted to buy but i thought that sgd13 95 per bottle was a bit steep i don t use salon shampoos so you can imagine i thought this was expensive my friend gave me the conditioner because it didn t work for her but i thought that it really made my hair softer and smoother so i went out and bought the shampoo anyway my hair is the bane of my existence my scalp can get greasy easily and my hair is fine so i look like snape on a bad day but i like how this line makes my hair weighty and glossy without being greasy i like what it does to my hair but i think my scalp is feeling a little dry and itchy i may need to alternate this with something for my scalp but this is definitely a good buy a word of caution i like the scent of vanilla but the smell is strong enough to make me gag if i shower on an empty stomach 
2008-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|cute packaging lovely vanilla smell and no sulfates i use this every other day using a little bit of shampoo and the roots and then loading the conditioner on the lower parts of my hair to the roots my hair has become a lot smoother softer and shinier the price is pretty good too at around 6 something per bottle would buy this again 
2008-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i use the vanilla silk shampoo and conditioner on a regular basis for my curly frizzy hair i love it when i do my hair curly i use this line because the shampoo doesn t dry my hair out i use a small amount and gently wash for 1 minute i tend not to scrub too hard otherwise i lose my curl pattern then i put on the silky conditioner squish it through my hair and leave it on for at least 5 minutes i don t comb my hair i use my fingers gently to comb thru the conditioner then after i rinse my curls are silky and bouncy i don t use this line every day sometimes i need to use a normal shampoo to wash out all my product build up but other than that i recommend this line for dry frizzy hair 
2008-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla|this is an ok shampoo fine but nothing special unless using a sulfate free shampoo is really important to you if that is the case this is a sulfate free option that is reasonably priced and widely available i m a bit surprised that a reviewer below said this is hard to find nearly every store in my area carries this line including wal mart target cvs and walgreens anyway like every sulfate free shampoo i ve tried this doesn t lather a lot though i did think the amount of lather was above average compared to other shampoos of this type it is heavily scented and it s a very foody vanilla so definitely avoid this product if that type of scent makes you gag one thing that annoys me about this brand is that the name and marketing suggest that the products are organic as far as i can tell the only organic ingredient in this product is a bit of organic vanilla bean oil imo any product that suggests it is organic ought to have a significant percentage of organic ingredients rant over all in all if you want a sulfate free shampoo this is probably one of the better ones available 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i used this at my friends house and now i can t wait to buy it i just have to finish off my other shampoo normally my hair dries really frizzy but after i used this and the matching conditioner it was smooth manegable and shiny and the scent is amazing the price isn t bad either and it s great that its natural 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i looooove this shampoo and conditioner however it s extremely hard to find i have extremely dry frizzy curly damaged hair and this is the only shampoo i have ever found that makes my hair feel smooth and healthy plus i love the smell and how it stays with you all day recently i dyed my hair black then i stripped it twice and then bleached it by all means my hair should have been spongy and falling out in clumps i later went to a hair dresser and she was shocked at how strong my hair still was after all the abuse she asked me what shampoo and conditioner i had been using and i told her all about this stuff i don t even have to deep condition once week either best stuff ever 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i love this shampoo it cleans my hair well and my hair still feels soft afterwards and does not weigh my hair down i was using clarifying shampoo way too often but i can cut back on it usinng this shampoo i love everything about it 
2008-08|2.0|Tahitian Vanilla|as a shampoo i found this so so does not seem like it does a good job of cleaning my hair the scent is pretty overwhelming i liken it to carnation instant breakfast french vanilla i do not find the scent to linger but do not care for it 
2008-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i think that this works just as well as the coconut version both make your hair look and feel soft and well cared for with a silkiness that just can t be topped i like all the organix shamps so far but i think the coconut milk one is my favorite good stuff 
2008-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|this smells really good i really purchase it because it is sulfate free i like the fact that even though it is sulfate free it still lathers it cleans my hair very well i really like the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and the shea butter conditioner as well 
2007-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i have curly wavy dryish shoulder length hair i ve been rotating davines love shampoo head and shoulders and nexxus therappe lately my scalp has been dry yet extremely greasy at the same time i picked this up thinking maybe it was the sulfates in the other shampoos and it has definately helped with the greasies it also makes my hair feel very clean but not stripped and soft as well i may try other products from organix 
2007-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i agree with the previous poster this shampoo makes me happy when i use it because the smell is so delicious i wish it lingered but it really doesn t for me and i have quot layered quot using the conditioner and blow dryer treatment as well this shampoo foams up fabulously which is great coming from a sulfate free product i too have used the shea butter version and my hair seems really silky since i have been using them the next time there is a good sale on these i am going to try the mandarin version for curly hair i am not in love with the packaging though i don t like the shape of the bottles to grab in the slick shower i d suggest a narrower cylindrical shape and an press flip top i can see these products being attractive in opaque bottles similar to the hempz products definitely give these products a try 
2007-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|please ladies buy this product i am in fear that it will become discontinued i m so in love with this shampoo i could cry the smell while it fades through out the day is so yummy it makes me so happy when i wash my hair in the morning yum the other plus about this shampoo is that it is an inexpensive sulfate free shampoo that has not faded my hair color what so ever it s so much cheaper than the other salon name sulfate free shampoos pureology sexy hair concepts i have tried the shea butter one and i liked that too but absolutely nothing compares to the texture and smell of vanilla silk it also makes my hair soft and sexy throughout the day 
2007-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla|found this target with a rebate coupon for both the shampoo conditioner free products who can resist wasn t expecting much since i am a salon shampoo snob sniff but hmmmm not bad the sickeningly sweet vanilla fades somewhat so that s a plus the lather is good and rinses clean the conditioner is lightweight and also rinses well i was skeptical of the cones but so far so good didn t leave my scalp itchy lippies off for the fat hard to manage bottles and the fliptop caps which i can see breaking off soon for free though what fun eta left my hair static y on these winter days demoted to 1 lippie
2007-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla|all i can say is yum this smells heavenly like vanilla cake it s a decent shampoo i use this with the conditioner my hair smells delicioso all day long and even until the next morning it s often on sale as quot buy 1 get 1 free quot so 2 for about 7 can t beat that 
2007-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i was drawn to the shampoo conditioner line after sampling the scent the scent is exactly like lipsmackers in vanilla yum unfortunately it doesn t linger after the shower it contains no harsh ingredients that are often found in drugstore shampoos conditioners makes my hair really soft doesn t weigh it down and is really shiny overall performs well as far as drugstore shampoos are concerned 
2007-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i had been spying the product for a while and when it went on sale bogo i figured why not the first couple times that i used this stuff it made my hair feel dry matted when i was shampooing after a few days my hair adjusted and it does not have that yucky feel my hair is nice and soft but i think it s still a bit drying my hair is getting staticy when i brush it i might give the coconut a try and if i have no luck there it back to dove 
2007-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i have the shampoo the smell yes is a little overpowerful but seriously it is amazing it is creamy and doesn t strip my hair of all the natural oils cleans very good lots of product about 13 ounces for about 7 at target i was in a grocery store in az and saw this stuff wanted to get it but 3 oz rule for airports finally went to target and there it was this the shea butter cond great hair i got about 10 compliments the day i first used it mmm
2007-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|this stuff worked amazing on my hair incredible softness yummylicios scent my locks look and feel great and well moistured i used it along with the conditioner left it to sink in for 5 minutes absolutely loved the result very satisfied with the product a definite repurchase 
2007-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i really wanted to like this and it made my hair feel nice but this shampoo severely stripped my semi perm color so did the coconut version will not repurchase for that reason 
2007-08|3.0|Tahitian Vanilla|i m quite happy with how this works for my color treated very dry hair especially given the affordable price planning to try one of their conditioners and i m a sucker for vanilla scents edited this vanilla became overpowering for me almost like milk gone bad after a few days i just couldn t take it anymore 
2007-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla| lt b gt me lt b gt 20 years old decided to give up a losing battle against hair down to my behind cut it to a couple inches below the shoulder what s left is much less damaged than what was cut but it still tends to dryness and is quite wavy can be very unmanageable without the right products right now my scalp is the most important detail to take care of it can get extremely oily and itchy if left to its own devices lt br gt lt br gt lt b gt the shampoo lt b gt retails at 7 for 13 ounces can be hard to find i found it at kroger s i have heard of people finding it at target the shampoo is creamy as opposed to a gel and it is absolutely the best smelling vanilla shampoo i ve ever used it is like a sweet butterscotch smoothie lt br gt lt br gt lt b gt my experience lt b gt my mother loves to buy random shampoos and try them out so there s always a whole repertoire of new ones i ve never tried laying around i always look at their ingredients and my stomach curdles at the sulfates and cones i was pleasantly surprised to find this one had none of that stuff it is sulfate free and the one cone it contains is water soluble it washes right off this was the first one of her new shampoos i felt it was safe to try lt br gt lt br gt i m very glad i did because it absolutely felt wonderful both on my head and once it was rinsed off i am shocked at how soft my hair feels when dry and how nice it left my scalp feeling there is no unbearably itchy feeling no cloying oiliness that so many shampoos afflicted on my head as soon as a day after i washed my hair using this shampoo i can go several days without cleansing my hair before i feel i have to do it and a shampoo that makes my scalp and hair feel wonderful is a revolution indeed in fact having this was the catalyst that made me cut off 3 4 of my hair i didn t want to do it til i had a great shampoo to back me up lt br gt lt br gt i have also used their smoothing shea butter and citrus mango shampoos the shea butter type seemed to be much the same as this one and in fact they share almost every ingredient so can be considered pretty much the same but the citrus mango i didn t like it had a cheap smell and it seemed less moisturizing lt br gt lt br gt lt br gt lt b gt ingredients lt b gt lt i gt di water aqua disodium laureth sulfosuccinate cocamidopropyl betaine cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine glycol distearate dimethicone copolyol cetyl alcohol cocamide dea guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride polyquaternium 11 hydantoin silk amino complex panthenol vitamin b 5 organic vanilla bean oil shea butter tocopheryl acetate vitamin e fragrance lt i gt 
2007-08|4.0|Tahitian Vanilla| since there isn t a separate space yet to review the shampoo and conditioner separately i m reviewing them together i would give the conditioner 5 lippies and the shampoo 3 1 2 lippies lt p gt i tried the tahitian vanilla shampoo and conditioner i love the conditioner it s not my favorite vanilla scent it s kind of a musky vanilla it really does not last long so whether you like dislike it it definitely won t last i love the results my hair is shiny smooth and so healthy looking whenever i use this conditioner it feels very moisturized it supposedly has silk amino proteins that seal the cuticle in order to make it silkier and shinier love lt p gt the shampoo is just average it is sulfate free so it does not really have a decent lather which is my preference i like the results i get with the conditioner when i pair it with a different shampoo i probably will not buy the shampoo again lt p gt the shampoo and conditioner retail for 6 99 each i am definitely looking forward to trying their blow dry cream but so far none of the stores in my area have it yet 
2007-08|1.0|Tahitian Vanilla|should have known better than to purchase this shampoo along with the conditioner i m not really sure what i expected the shampoo made my hair feel very tangled this is not usually the case with pantene or even victoria s secret shampoo moved on to the conditioner which was worse sat in my hair an did nothing and i used a lot of it had to wash it out and use my pantene intensive hair mask which as usual did a great job would never recommend this to anyone but a bald headed man and even then the scent is too vanilla for me not good if you don t like foodie scents in you hair body products 
2007-08|5.0|Tahitian Vanilla|the vanilla bean shampoo made my color treated parched dry hair silky even though it s sulfate free it does have a medium lather and doesn t weight my hair down the smell is yummy 
2012-08|2.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|despite having a negative experience using the coconut line from organix i decided to give the company one more chance so i purchased the shea shampoo conditioner this shampoo did not do much for my hair it did not take away my frizz nor did it make my hair more manageable or nourished my hair was more dry after using this product the shampoo did lather up nicely and the scent was nice i will not repurchase 
2012-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i love it its my favourite shampoo it made my hair super manageble and it totally got rid of my frizz also it hydrates the hair very well the only bad thing is that it dosen t volumize but that isin t so importanat to me
2012-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|while i m currently in love with the macadamia oil line from organix this shea butter line was horrible for my curly hair the shampoo and conditioner totally dried my hair out and made it completely unmanageable i bought and tried this when i used to wash blow dry then straighten my hair and it made the whole process a nightmare it added more time to my routine because my hair was very dry and brittle i only used this once and i tossed it 
2012-08|4.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i wish i could keep using this shampoo but i cant when i bought it it made my hair soft and super shiny even my boyfriend noticed it lol and he never notices stuff like that so i was happy but then after a few weeks it started giving me dandruff d so i had to quit it
2012-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i love this shampoo i ve been using it for several months now with fantastic results i definitely noticed a difference after switching to this my hair feels lighter softer and smoother the smell is very pleasant too it s mild and not overpoweringly sweet like some shea butter products i ve tried if only their conditioner didn t contain silicones i d try that as well 
2011-08|2.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i just bought this and the matching conditioner this evening and hopped in the shower after getting home to give it a go well the shampoo is utterly drying it lathers great smells nice cute packaging but left do much to be desired for moisture i will try to pawn this off on so to finish it up and i ll find something else that really works for me 
2011-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i purchased this after hearing basically a mix bag of reviews i heard that organix shampoo is the best and i also heard it was horrid i decided to go ahead and purchase this let s start out with information about my hair i do not dye my hair nor use lots of chemicals nor use lots of heat appliances on it my first purchase among the organix line was the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and brazilian keratin therapy shampoo and conditioner and this organix shea butter smoothing shampoo and the conditioner are my holy grail this stuff actually tames my minor frizz and makes it smell so wonderful the shampoo one is a bit more drying than the other shampoos in the organix line but once you condition your hair it comes out silky and smooth overall my verdict is to definitely try the shea butter smoothing line of products you won t be disapointed 
2011-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i also was surprised by the bad reviews on this product although i get that the shampoo alone feels drying i have thick but fine hair that tends to get puffy and very not smooth i was initially a little disappointed too but then i made sure to follow the directions on the bottle to keep the conditioner on for at least 3 minutes make sure to apply the conditioner thoroughly to the parts of my hair that most need smoothing and rinse thoroughly unlike i would have previously with conditioners after playing around with how i use it i m in love my experience with this product honestly has erased my life long skepticism about the potential benefits of any one product i started using this shamp cond 3 mos ago and my hair has been much softer and smoother ever since for best results i use a very small dab of the organix shea butter smoothing serum again i thought it was worthless at first because it s essentially just oil but if you figure out the right amount that works for your hair it has great effects in smoothing and shining i find it also makes my hair more likely to do what i want these products aren t the cheapest but i find they work better than some much more expensive hair care products that i ve tried 
2011-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|such bad ratings on my hg product i am stunned i think that this product is so wonderful matter of fact i love the whole organix line this product smells yummy and it is very smoothing however the shampoo of the shea butter is a bit drying when it is rinsed clean but after applying the conditioner my hair gets really soft and silky 
2011-08|4.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|ohlala moisture at last winco carries these for 3 bucks a bottle 
2011-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i tried this and the smell was amazing and by reading the front it looked like what i needed it made my hair dry and that upset me what i did love was that it was sulfate free and lathered well though 
2010-08|4.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|this stuff smells amazing for not having sulfates it also lathers surprisingly well i wash my hair every day and i don t have any issues with dryness or frizziness while using this 
2010-08|3.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]| edit i was recently out of town and was using a different shampoo when i returned home and washed my hair with this i was disappointed to see how this left my hair weighed down and tangled compared to what i was using away from home the suave almond amp shea butter one in case you were wondering so i m tossing this and switching original review is below i actually don t think this product is all that terrible my hair is thick and a bit below my shoulders in length texture wise it is fine and i have a lot of static and flyaways no matter what the season however this does become worse in the winter when it is quite dry in my house the shampoo makes my hair feel very clean even giving my hair that quot squeak quot which i wouldn t expect from a shea butter shampoo it doesn t make my hair smoother than normal i have yet to find something that does but it doesn t make it worse i also have bangs too and it does not make my hair too greasy either i wash at night so not the best product ever but not the spawn of satan either bonus the scent really lingers in my hair and it smells nice 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|smoothing not so much flattening dull hair very so disappointing it seemed so great sls free great smell decent price just a big no my hair was lifeless and i didn t even finish the bottle 
2010-08|2.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i ve previously used the coconut organix and should have learned my lesson while these products promise a lot and they do smell great and have cute packaging they just don t deliver the shea butter products seemed okay at first after shampooing my hair was extremely tangled and felt stripped but after the conditioner it felt silky and soft i didn t notice any particular quot smoothing quot ability though after about 2 weeks use my hair was dried out with frizz and i gave these to my husband to finish them up my hair tends to be somewhat dry and i only wash about twice a week these might be okay if you have oily hair and only wash once a week but if your hair is at all dry or has any damage avoid the shampoo strips your hair and the conditioner isn t hydrating enough to recover it won t repurchase 
2010-08|4.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i actually like this but i do not use the conditioner in the line i rotate this with 2 of the other scents and always use a sulfate shampoo on sunday to get any buildup out i also only wash every other day for conditioner when i use these i use dove s deep moisture conditioner as far as sulfate free shampoo i like it alot it suds up and doesn t upset my scalp i ve tried both the sally beauty hair one wen knock off sulfate free cleansing conditioner and the loreal sulfate free can t remember if it was everpure or everstrong and both made my scalp sensitive itchy and sore after one use this does not of the 3 scents i have in this this makes my hair nicest it does smooth it a bit as indicated but i still need heavy duty conditioner it also smells really good but so far scent wise the coconut is my favorite i would buy this again but once i use all three up i plan to try other scents 
2010-08|4.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i really like this shampoo it smells amazing i love how the shampoo looks its kinda shimmery and pretty although it doesnt lather well that doesnt really bother me much as i know it still does its job it made my hair feel amazing and the smell lasts all day not a fan of the size of the bottle for the price but id still buy it again 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|contrary to its labeling this shampoo is very drying even after conditioning it left my hair dry tangled and feeling like straw i would not recommend 
2010-08|2.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|bought this because it s sls free and available at the drugstore it does an okay job at cleaning my hair but it s too drying i prefer their coconut milk shampoo the price is reasonable if you can find it on sale 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i tried this because i figured it would be more gentle due to the product claiming to be so natural and sulfate free i regret this purchase it s not all that natural the shampoo doesn t cleanse your hair well and the conditioner that matches it doesn t do a good job either i tried another organix shampoo and conditioner with lavender that was no good either just leaves a frizzy greasy mess what a disappointment i have yet to find a sulfate free product that actually works 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|one of the worst shampoos i ve ever tried it left ends in many knots it dried them out and made them brittle after a few washes i love the fact that it s organic and the packaging and scent is very likable it made my long hair tangly brittle and dry i will definately not buy this again and i encourage you to not waste your money on this overly priced shampoo 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|wow talk about being mislead once i smelled this and read the bottle s description i was too excited to try it it was sooo drying especially for a shampoo that is quot sulfate free quot smh i would never buy his again if anyone knows a shampoo that is sulfate free and will not strip my hair please let me know 
2010-08|4.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|first this review is not for the shampoo it is for the hair serum it was not listed so they forced me to pick the shampoo anyways i have dry thin hair but the hair strands themselves are thick i picked it from cvs and i was certain i would be returning it after 1 use but that did not happen because this product not only smells really nice it works wonders if you have slightly curly dry hair naturally or because you abuse it then you should give it a try i paid 4 bucks for it cause i had a coupon but it is only about dollars so the price is very encouraging ps if you are not sure about a product i would say buy it from a place where to would refund you even it you have used it that is the only reason i buy from cvs really for some reason target refuses to refund if product have been opened 
2010-08|3.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|the product received rave reviews on various aa natural hair blogs the product was on clearance at a local store for 2 99 so i gave it a try it has a great scent and assists with making my hair soft and managable if it was priced lower i would purchase it again i would not purchase it at the regular price 
2010-08|4.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|less drying than the coconut shampoo the smell is nice too it doesn t seem to lather as much as my old pantene but my hair does get clean i also wash every other day so it has to go through a bit of grime and grease my ends aren t as rough or dry as before not bad and i d buy this again until i find that perfect shampoo that won t strip or dry and leave my ends all soft and silky without having to use heavy conditioners or product if such a thing even exists update growing my hair long and i need to shampoo every day because of acne and pollen allergies this shampoo was fine for every other day but every day it s too drying 
2010-08|4.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i bought the coconut and the shea butter shampoo i used the coco first and it was ok then i put the shea one the difference could be felt it was very moisturising and felt quenched it does need more than i would usually need from my treseemme but i liked it 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|couldnt wait to get in to the shower with the description and smell but i was let down i didnt feel like this product cleaned my hair also claimin that it has avacado oils vit e ect i didnt find it very hydrating and soothing 
2010-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i was standing in the shower squirting some of this product into my palm when i noticed this product s scent and consistency anyone who has ever tried organic product knows that fragrances tend to be a little more subtle and consistences tend to be different than mainstream products this product had neither qualities it had the same consistency of regular shampoos and a strong a little too good smell i flipped the back over and read the ingredients nothing said quot organic quot and then i realized this product isn t organic they simply named their brand quot organix quot and threw around words like quot pure quot don t be fooled people this product isn t really organic so while i must admit it smelled great and lathered up well i could never give my money to a company that is knowingly deceiving consumers 
2009-08|4.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i m surprised by the low ratings and bad reviews for this shampoo i don t think this is the best shampoo that i have ever tried but it definitely isn t the worst as far as i m concerned it s perfectly mid range i m on my second bottle and i haven t noticed any drying it has a strange almost jelly like consistency it smells nice and lathers up pretty well the first time and much much better during a repeat wash i only shampoo every other day so the first shampoo is going onto a pretty oily scalp it s a bit expensive for a drugstore shampoo but i only buy this stuff on sale or when they go 2 for 1s in which case the price isn t that bad 
2009-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|great smell very drying i ve used this for several weeks and my hair became more dried out and unruly over time the matching conditioner doesn t counterbalance the drying effects of this shampoo maybe okay for someone that doesn t have dry curly hair to begin with but it was destructive to my hair 
2009-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i m suprised to see such low ratings for this i purchased it because all the drugstore shampoos seem to suck all the moisture out of my hair and make it very dry my hair seems dry for the whole day the day i shampoo and next day i get some moisuture back weird so i decided to purchase sulfate free shampoo to see if it made any difference and to my surprise it did i ve been using this now for about 4th time and my hair has never looked healthier and not dry in many years hg shampoo and condiitoner will definately purchase again and again 
2009-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|my hair turned into a brillo pad it took several deep conditioners and prayers to unravel the monster the shampoo created the minute that shampoo touched my gorgeous ringlets the hair just turned unruly stay away 
2009-08|2.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i liked this for awhile it smells great and seemed pretty gentle but after a couple of months of use it dried out my hair 
2009-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|very gentle shampoo yet it cleanses effectively my curly hair likes this shampoo it s sulfate free and its shea butter formula leaves my hair smooth and soft i am really impressed by organix 
2009-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i love this shampoo i have color treated hair and use mostly demi permanent color on it i have tried other sls free shampoos that claim they will not strip color and in fact did this one really seems to keep the color from stripping it doesn t lather that well but most sls free ones don t it s the sls that causes big lather i like the smell and it leaves my hair really shiny i get it for less than 6 usd at my local heb and i think it s a great buy it lasts a long time 
2009-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i had bought this shampoo along with the matching conditioner with such high hopes unfortunately i wish i could get my money back the shampoo does not build up into any kind of a lather and after following with the conditioner my hair felt like straw buyer beware i would never buy from this line again it s a shame because i expected so much more 
2008-08|3.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|this shampoo is nice amp has a beautiful scent that last all day it rinses clean but leaves hair a bit dry if you do use this beware do not use with it s matching conditioner the organix shea butter conditioner is terrible you re better off not using conditioner at all my hair actually felt drier after i applied it ugh 
2008-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|i really like this shampoo i have really wavy hair that s also frizzy on top of that i also have a lot of volume this shampoo hasn t really brought the frizz or volume of my hair down as much as i d like but i ve noticed that it did a bit of that which is better than nothing however the great thing about this shampoo is that it makes my hair smells good i ve also noticed that my scalp feels cleaner and that my hair looks and feels healthier and smoother love how it s sulfate free will definitely purchase again and looking forward to add the coconut milk shampoo as well 
2008-08|3.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|this shampoo smells so good my hair felt clean and smooth after using it but i ve noticed that the day of shampooing my hair is really fluffy and frizzy i don t think i would buy this particular shampoo again maybe i would try something else in the organix line 
2008-08|1.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|oh my word worst shampoo ever my hair feels like straw 
2008-08|5.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]|great shampoo for the money and it is sulfate free another huge plus smells slightly butter vanilly with an underlying coconut scent much like all of the shampoos in this line really makes my hair soft and smooth and i get tons of compliments every time i use it another great product from organix 
2008-08|3.0|Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]| this review is for the organix shea butter shampoo while i love most of the organix products i have tried this shampoo did not do it for me i think that the coconut and vanilla silk versions are far superior to this kind of dried my hair out and needless to say i wouldn t buy this again 
2012-08|5.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|the smell is heavenly and the bottle is my favorite color so i had to try i have curly 3b 3c curls and wear my hair natural everyone is complaining on how it is not moisturizing but it is a shampoo if you don t condition afterwards obviously it is going to be dry and thats probably why your hair is in bad condition however paired with conditioner it feels great i especially like it because there are no sulfates which strip your hair unnecessarily 
2012-08|1.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|i was looking for a new shampoo conditioner and brought this it smells divine i love the smell of mandarin oranges since it reminds me of my childhood but my hair did not feel clean after using this it did not lather well probably because it has no sulfate it smells great but that s about it it did not clean my hair and it did not make it any softer or healthier actually i think it made my hair worse i have curly hair btw but bottom line i think this is a waste of money and i would never repurchase i didn t even finish the bottle i brought a different shampoo and concitioner because this is absolutely terrible 
2011-08|1.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|this product sucks never again will i buy such a thing and a funny thing is that i was at my bestfriends house and she was talking to me about this really bad shampoo she had bought and i was like omg me too let me see yours and she showed me it amp it was the same product i had purchased we both laughed and critisized this 
2011-08|5.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|this is a great product i love the packaging and it makes my hair feel so nice totally worth it 
2011-08|2.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|just so so smells nice cleans well rinses out easily i like that the packaging is a more eco friendly plastic i thought that the olive oil component of this would be more frizz smoothing but did not get the results i was looking for i will use up the bottle but my search is still on 
2011-08|3.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|these lines of hair products seem nice i really like this one i ve tried the coconut milk shampoo conditioner tea tree oil mint shampoo conditioner and a few others and this one is pretty good too it s gentle on my highlights lowlights lathers up really nicely sells wonderful and leaves my hair once it s dried silky smooth and soft only complaints i have is that i wish they would redo their bottle shape cap and i hate that my hair feels dried out super tangled before it s dried
2010-08|4.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|i bought this by accident when i ws going to buy conditioner and picked up the wrong bottle but i love this shampoo it cleans my hair really well and doesn t leave any weird residue it s scent is nice and very light compared to other organix products i have tried i love that this company doesn t test on animals it is not the best shampoo i have ever used but it is very good i will buy this again in the future 
2010-08|1.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo| __reviewtextreadmorev2__ data enableyoutubepreview true data productid 115577 data reviewid 1874923 data text never never never again i bought this product because i liked the way it smelled and since my hair is fine and heat damaged i thought that this organix replenishing shampoo would help however i was very wrong first of all it lathers badly secondly it left my hair feeling dry and strawlike and the smell does not stick organix products are fairly expensive but luckily i got this on sale at a local drugstore i will never buy this product again never never never again i bought this product because i liked the way it smelled and since my hair is fine and heat damaged i thought that this organix replenishing shampoo would help div
2010-08|5.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|where s the love i have no qualms with this product in fact i really like it it leaves my long hair feeling squeaky clean and not overly dry or oily the smell is citrusy with a hint of an olive oil tang that does not bother me at all i love pantene and use it regularly but i find this product is a nice break and change of pace for my hair does not tend to weigh my hair down as pantene can do if i m not careful in applying it with a light hand and not to my roots worth a try i got it buy one get one free at cvs and it s a keeper would repurchase again on sale edit i am loving this product it leaves my hair so weightless and yet shiny and smooth truly a great fit for me reaching for it now more and more frequently i think in the warmer months my hair can t tolerate the products that pile on the moisture it craves more in the winter this stuff is great 
2010-08|2.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|smells good but it is very drying and not at all hydrating for my thick and wavy hair i am a sucker for citrus scented products so i picked up this with the matching conditioner bogof it too smells good but lacks moisturizing qualities would be very annoyed if i had paid full price for it 
2010-08|1.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|i bought this product along with the conditioner for the smell i had never used this brand of hair product before and i will never use it again i have long hair and i straighten it often so my hair gets dry especially in the winter and this shampoo made my hair ten times worse in only one use i could tell my hair was worse i stopped using it after a week dont buy this unless you don t care about having straw like hair 
2009-08|2.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|i didn t like this product one bit well at first when i was at the store i smelled it and it smelled pretty good but then when i went home and washed my hair with it i got really annoyed at the smell and it has a really bad lather i don t want to waste it so i used another shampoo before i use this one to make let this product soak in my hair better but even though i found a way to use this product better while i was for lathering when i was done the next day it itched like hell i just don t even use it anymore what a waste of money thank gosh it wasn t expensive got it for buy one get one throwing this product away fersure 
2009-08|1.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|used this with the mandarin olive oil conditioner had no objection to the way it made my hair feel but the smell was something else my husband kindly told me that is smelled like a and proceeded to say that if we were on a first date and he smelled my hair on that alone he would run threw out the products and voila no more atrocious smell it s laughable but true ladies this product smells like a once its in your hair 
2008-08|4.0|Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo|on the fence about this one as i always seem to get weigh down on my hair whenever i use these shampoos the scent of this is wonderful kind of orangey and it supposed to quot heal quot split ends and frayed damaged hair i don t know about these claims but it does seem to defrizz my hair and smoothes it to some extent as with the shea butter shampoo my hair feels slightly coated and a bit oily maybe it s the olive oil factor don t know overall though this seems to clean my hair pretty well though i would like it to be shinier not a great shampoo in my opinion but not bad either haven t decided whether i would buy this again love the bottle though 
2012-08|4.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|note this is a mostly natural shampoo conditioner so you need to leave it in your hair longer i just got the conditioner and it says that you should leave it in 3 to 5 minutes if you don t leave it in long enough it won t penetrate and it s like you re not using conditioner that being said pros smells amazing makes my hair really soft and shiny cons have to use a lot and a bit more quot high maintenance quot than your average conditioner with the waiting times you can probably buy better conditioner for less money overall i like it it makes my hair feel nice smell nice and look nice it doesn t make my hair feel greasy and works well with the crappy color shampoo i need to use 
2011-08|1.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|i do not recommend this shampoo because it leaves your hair extremely tangly i accidently picked up two conditioners at rite aid instead of a shampoo and conditioner and now im going to go and return both bottles 
2010-08|2.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|this product smells very good if you re into fresh ripened fruits as a shampoo it s very drying it doesn t lather very well and it leaves my hair feeling stripped of all its moisture i paid about 3 99 for it but i generally see it priced for 4 99 for that price i would expect something a lot better its purpose now is to clean my makeup brushes 
2010-08|1.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|cute packaging great smell but a stinker of a product i was drawn to both of these factors when i picked up this shampoo and conditioner but at 11 99 each i expected a bit more than the straw i was left with i was really disappointed as the packaging emphasis the effect on your hair more than the fact it was a shampoo with organic ingredients in it the conditioner is so thin i may as well have rubbed water in my hair i m really disappointed in this will be returning to my regular set buyer beware this product wouldn t be worth picking up if it was half the price 
2010-08|4.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|i like this smells fantastic lathers well and cleanses without stripping i got a 26 oz bottle for 3 99 at rite aid plus the matching conditioner for free 
2010-08|1.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|i really wanted to like this product i have tried it for two months hoping to fall in love but it just didn t happen i found the quot organic quot ingredients appealing and the fact that it had no sulfates etc etc anyways it majorly dried out my normal hair and left it tangled beyond belief even with the conditioner that also did squat the best thing i can say about this is that it did clean my hair and it smells great but other than that i do not recommend 
2010-08|1.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|terrible at first it worked wonders for me then i noticed that if i didn t use with conditioner my hair would be frizzy and unmangeable i have typical asian hair which was long and silky before this shampoo going back to my trusted garnier i m even urging my suitemates to use this shampoo because i don t wanna waste it but i m not using it if it turns my normally silky hair into straw 
2010-08|1.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|what sold me on this shampoo was the scent it s amazinggg then i actually tried it it was horrible so incredibly drying my hair felt like straw i found the consistency of the shampoo very strange almost lumpy and goopy my friend has oily hair and it works wonders for her but i have normal dry hair so this was a complete nightmare i gave them away 
2010-08|4.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|first off i luuuuurve the scent of this i have fine straight non color treated oily hair this combination makes it somewhat hard to find a good shampoo because i always want the volumizing ones which always make my hair look greasy this doesn t really volumize but it doesn t really make my hair greasy either it just makes my hair shiny and soft and smell good overall a win in my book 
2010-08|5.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|i got this one and the lavender soy milk marked down at target i am completely in love with these shampoos they have transformed my hair which is now more bouncy and has more volume i just picked up two more on sale at meijer love it 
2010-08|4.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|i picked up this shampoo because i was out of my staple jason biotin shampoo and didn t have time in the schedule to trek to the specialty store that carries it i ve been using this for more than a month now and it has been a great replacement for my fine long hair i m in the process of growing my hair to waist length and this shampoo leaves it feeling good consistently will definitely alternate with my jason shampoo in the future 
2010-08|1.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo|i ve been buying sls free shampoos for over 4 years now since developing an allergy at first i really liked this shampoo it smells good and had a decent lather to it unfortunate within a couple of weeks i had noticed that my scalp always felt sore and i was beginning to lose hair like crazy recently i noticed some little blisters on my scalp i ll be going back to my yes to carrots shampoo asap 
2010-08|4.0|Passionfruit Guava Shampoo| __reviewtextreadmorev2__ data enableyoutubepreview true data productid 130208 data reviewid 1761281 data text this is supposed to be an engergizing shampoo that is designed to reawaken tired dull tresses the scent is nothing short of wonderful and very tropical and exotic and it does seem to add body life and moisture without a heavy weigh down some of the organix shampoos i have used the past seem to leave a weird film on my hair despite clarifying it weekly and rinsing really well this one does not and that is a good thing seems to really add shine and my hair has that light bouncy non weighed down feel i crave good stuff this is supposed to be an engergizing shampoo that is designed to reawaken tired dull tresses the scent is nothing short of wonderful and very tropical and exotic and it does seem to add body div
2012-08|5.0|Coconut Milk & White Lotus Body Mist|i am utterly thrilled that this product exists i originally used organix coconut conditioner a few months ago but it was useless on my highlighted highlighted hair so i gave it away today i was in riteaid and was looking around for a product that smelled just like the conditioner and low and behold i almost fell over when i saw that this exists the smell is divine its like sweet honeyed coconut with some toasted almonds thrown in and a touch of vanilla omg if i were making a dessert this is what i d like to make very moisturizing also only downside is that the top leaks ever so slightly if you re looking for coconut scent this is it 
2012-08|4.0|Coconut Milk & White Lotus Body Mist|i purchased this because i absolutely loved the scent of the coconut milk shampoo which is an amazing shampoo by the way although this mist does have some white lotus in it it seems like the same scent of coconut milk shampoo to me basically the only ingredients in this mist that are contributing to the scent is coconut extract and white lotus extract so there aren t really any quot top notes quot quot middle notes quot or quot bottom notes quot but meh it still smells great i just spritz two spritz in my hair so that whenever people ask me what scent it is i just tell them that it s my new shampoo lol because the coconut milk shampoo scent doesn t linger in my hair and honestly i d rather my hair smell like coconut than my neck wrist i prefer actual perfume for my neck this is a real coconut scent by the way it s not that cheap fake coconut scent in tanning lotions i rated this a 4 because of the poor packaging the bottle it comes in is poorly made it does spray an even fine mist but it also leaks out of the bottom part of the spritzer but other than that i love it i m so glad i managed to snatch the last bottle of this at rite aid the price was 10 very reasonable would i repurchase no 
2012-08|4.0|Coconut Milk & White Lotus Body Mist|i m addicted the fragrance it s just so delicious as a body spray it isn t the best the fragrance doesn t last long it doesn t really moisturize or do anything really plus the spray bottle is kind of defective when you spray it leaks out of the screw on part and drips all over bottle pretty but not functional i have been so in love with the fragrance and natural ingredients that i now use it in my hair it makes a fabu hair product i use it as a finishing spray so i have that delicious fragrance in my hair all day it adds some texture to my hair and enhances the curls and bounciness there is some kind of alcohol in it but i ve found that it isn t drying at all i definitely will be buying this again i hope though they ll fix the issue with the bottle i don t get why it s so drippy and sloppy other than that it s a great thing 
2011-08|3.0|Coconut Milk & White Lotus Body Mist|i have literally just used this product so it may grow on me but my first impression is not so great it does have a lovely smell and does soften my skin a bit although it gives a slight burning sensation when applied on freshly shaven legs but the packaging makes it so inconvenient to use it comes in a round spray bottle that gets smaller at the top right where you want to grip it to spray and if you grip it too hard you ll drop it if you try to spray upside down or at an angle big drops drip out and run down your hand which i find very inconvenient especially for a body spray on the whole it s not really worth it for 10 and a crappy bottle 
2012-08|3.0|Ever Slim Coconut Milk Sugar Cane Smoothing Body Wash|i bought this because i love the smell of coconuts and i needed a new body wash bar i was previously using dove bars but i like to try new things when i finish what i was currently using i ordered this from amazon for about 13 dollars and when it finally came in the mail i was so excited to try it the smell is slightly coconut but it s overpowered by the smell of the sugarcane which isn t necessarily a bad thing but i really wanted a strong sweet coconut smell for the summer the body wash doesn t really lather which i don t like because i feel as though i have to use more of it to feel clean i use exfoliating gloves and they can create a lot of lather even if i don t use a lot of product i don t feel as though it s made my skin any softer but i will continue using it until i finish the bottle 
2012-08|4.0|Ever Slim Coconut Milk Sugar Cane Smoothing Body Wash|i m reviewing the creamy oil body wash called hydrating moroccan argan oil this stuff smells wonderful i mean this is the best scent in a body wash i ve come across ever sort of musky earthy contains argan oil which is a plus love the consistency the only thing i don t love is the price because it is a tad expensive and i found it while looking for another brand at walmart lol another thing i think is odd is that it contains sugar cane as an ingredient not sure why sugar needs to be in a body wash anyway if you re a bath person like i am it makes for a nice grown up bubble bath i ll definitely return and get the cherry blossom scented one as well since i smelled that one in the store and it was fantastic too 13 fluid ounces for almost 7 00 if i could change two things about this product i d want to see the sugar removed and the price lowered a bit 
2011-08|4.0|Ever Slim Coconut Milk Sugar Cane Smoothing Body Wash|i love this new body line from organix this is a sweet summery coconut it is gorgeous it is a bit pricey though 
2011-08|5.0|Ever Slim Coconut Milk Sugar Cane Smoothing Body Wash|this is the perfect summer body wash no beyond perfect i d been using suave lavender vanilla which was great but i splurged and picked this up because the smell is irresistible the packaging is adorable and the promises on the bottle sounded fantastic and this stuff is fantastic the scent really is delectable not entirely coconut it smells like a coconut vanilla cookie sundae it s drool worthy however it doesn t linger on my skin but i ll live in terms of the product itself it cleans without drying out the skin and leaves my whole body feeling and looking smooth young and bright i said this stuff is perfect for summer because it never leaves you feeling greasy never leaves you feeling dry rinses off completely and has the perfect summer fragrance mind you it s a little pricey 9 99 for the amount you get is kinda silly but it s worth it now i have to try the matching lotion xd
2012-08|5.0|Cherry Blossom Rose Water Refreshing Facial Toner|i am absolutely in love with this toner it was an impulse buy at ulta because it was on clearance for 7 and i had been needing a toner for quite some time i love the smell of this toner and i love how it makes my skin feel i live in arizona so my skin is always taking a beating i love getting out of the shower after i ve washed my face and applying this stuff it s very refreshing and once again nothing beats the smell of this toner 
2011-08|3.0|Cherry Blossom Rose Water Refreshing Facial Toner| edit noooooooooo this toner has been breaking me out every time i use it i develop new huge acne pimples normally if i break out they are just little tiny ones this sucks because i really loved this toner beware if you have acne prone skin is all i have to say im going to put this in a spray bottle and use it lightly as a spray to set powder foundation and to spray in my hair and make my hair smell nice that should be just fine once it runs out though i probably wont be rebuying maybe i will if im still addicted to how amazing it smells though i love this toner its smells so amazing i almost wish i could eat it this toner makes my skin look very soft and fresh it really does replenish my skins moisture and gives me a little glow its very refreshing and ive had zero side effects no burning no irritating no breakouts etc i will absolutely repurchase this when i bought this i was originally looking for the burts bees rosewater and glycerin toner but i couldnt find it then i happened to come across this one and gave it a wiff and i just couldnt resist buying it i bought this at ulta for 5 and some change although i have seen it at rite aid for about 8 
2011-08|5.0|Cherry Blossom Rose Water Refreshing Facial Toner|so lovely i was extremely surprised by the amazing fragrance of this toner and it s wonderful properties as well i was shopping rite aid bogo sale and thought i would take a chance on this absolutely fabulous it reminds me of guerlain lovely cherry blossom scent combined with rosewater packaging is cute just a bit top heavy and the flip top might prove awkward no big deal though i will totally be repurchasing this product 
2011-08|5.0|cucumber yogurt shampoo|i can t believe all the negative reviews for this product on this site the organix cucumber yogurt shampoo is my absolute favorite love the fragrance and it leaves my hair more manageable than any other shampoo i ve tried and i try a new one about every month or two i probably sound like i work for the company or they re paying me for a good review or something but i swear this is my honest opinion of this product i rarely write product reviews but was disappointed to see my favorite shampoo getting trashed so badly it s unfortunate that this shampoo doesn t work for everyone but try it for yourself you might be pleasantly surprised 
2011-08|5.0|cucumber yogurt shampoo|this is amazing because it doesn t strip my hair and detangles very easily with a wide tooth comb price it sorta reasonable since it has 13oz lasted it me quite a while and smells amazing bubbles sulfates why does it matter that it doesn t lather well as long as it clean your hair i will continue to buy this
2010-08|1.0|cucumber yogurt shampoo|sure it looks cute amp the fact that its organic makes you wanna buy it more amp it smells good but thats it my hair hated it my hair was tangled amp didnt feel nice at all 
2010-08|2.0|cucumber yogurt shampoo|hmm this is my first time buying this product i bought it at watson and it was about 25 even with discount o o i don t know about you but thats a little too pricey for me nevertheless i gave it a try because the scent was f a n t a s i c here s my opinion the lather is too i had to use about 1 palm size for my shoulder length hair i felt that it was not enough and i don t think i can get use to this kind of consistency whereby it is not thick sorry for poor explanation it was strange that the top felt dry and the middle felt ok ok and the ends felt fab i think it is too drying for me btw i have a dry scalp and oily hair now i m using this as my conditioner just to finish it however i do not recommend this 
2010-08|1.0|cucumber yogurt shampoo|the list is endless how terrible this product is i love the smell and i don t mind the consistency if the product actually worked i figured since i have naturally dry and damaged curly hair this was the reasoning for why the product was not moisturizing enough but seeing other reviews this product is terrible for even oily straight hair the shampoo seems to give all hair types very coarse brittle hair extremely disappointed will never repurchase i was hoping for a moisturizing silicone sulfate free shampoo that smelled good after wash but i will have to go back to my original shampoo i would say this would be better for oily prone hair but even then most people would have the same results 
2009-08|1.0|cucumber yogurt shampoo|wow and i mean that in a bad way this shampoo left my hair matted and dried so badly that no one conditioner could reverse it i threw on every conditioner in the house just to be able to work my fingers through my hair what s up with these quot natural quot shampoos and conditioners my hair ends up brittle frizzed and dried out no matter what brand i use i m done with these i gave it a 1 just because i liked the smell i m not buying again and i don t recommend it for anything other than hand soap 
2009-08|2.0|cucumber yogurt shampoo|pros it does have alot of natural products packaging is cute and compact scent is great cons too expensive for such a little bottle since it has no sulfates it doesn t lather up so the texture is like that of egg whites i really did not like that didn t feel like it did anything for my hair please don t fall for the trap of it being amazing for your hair the descriptions on the bottle are really good but the product sucks 
2011-08|4.0|Awakening Mocha Espresso|this shampoo smells good not quite foody but mildly coffee y and cocoa y it strikes me as a very unisex scent the texture is gel like similar to other organix shampoos i ve used it takes some getting used to but it s workable i found that the shampoo cleanses okayh but must definitely be followed with a conditioner i d never expect to not have to follow a shampoo with conditioner so this isn t a negative in my mind i have a really oily scalp and i don t think this shampoo provides as much cleansing as i really need to avoid being oily on the 2nd day it would probably work better for people with a drier scalp and dry hair where it smelled good and cleansed well enough for daily use i won t be repurchasing it 
2010-08|5.0|Awakening Mocha Espresso|i wish i could find this in stores i bought it last summer and loved the it smelled amazing i don t normally like organix but this was great 
2008-08|4.0|Awakening Mocha Espresso|its fall and time to put in an effort to a more pulled together look so i wanted to do something for my hair without actually color processing it i have naturally dark brown hair with very subtle highlights which takes on color easily so a color depositing shampoo made sense i really wanted l oreal colorist collection but couldn t get it close to where i live hence went with this one i have to say it works quite well its a pretty decent shampoo so first my hair gets clean and then it brings out the colors very naturally i couldn t get the conditioner but will make do with my trusty garnier which worked out well very pleased with the results
2011-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i don t think this product does anything it is very strongly scented with a fairly artificial coconut smell it is a runny liquid that is supposed to heat in your palms presumably to enhance the product s abilities however the heat doesn t last long enough to reach the hair gimmick it probably does give a little shine i ve not noticed any but maybe if used on dry hair won t repurchase 
2011-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|ok so i know that coconut oil is supposed to be great for your hair but what s up with this product its directions are strange telling me to shampoo then apply to dry hair and rinse it didn t soften my hair and it felt tangled in the shower i ended up pulling out a lot of hair because it didn t detangle my hair in the shower it s really thin and runny and i can t even tell if it did something to my hair i won t buy again 
2011-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i like this oil i bought it a while back and forgot about it i just recently found it and fell in love with it again it smells good to i use it on dry or wet hair i love the whole organix brand period
2010-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i actually use this after my shower i use 1 pump and leave it in my hair no rinsing it leaves my hair shiny and smooth and tames my curls but if i use too much i m left with flat greasy hair for some reason all the drug stores in my area have stopped carrying it so i have to settle on buying it online 
2010-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|the product hets up a little whenever you massage it onto your hair it s very thin the directions instruct you to apply it after shampooing leave on for 3 5 mins amp rinse i followed the directions closely for the first use amp i kept it on much longer for the 2nd use 45 mins i gave this product a three because i didn t notice much improvement in the condition of my hair but it smells nice i will use the remainder of the product but i won t purchase it again 
2010-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i have used a few bottles of this now i really love the way it smells and how soft if makes your hair feel it also helps with fly aways and frizz just a word of warning you do need to be careful to avoid your roots this is greasy and a little goes a long way especially near the roots of your head otherwise you will look a little greasy the self heating is fun but i m not sure it is any different than the non self heating version i ve used both and might slightly prefer the non heating because it just seems odd that it heats up personal preference though there really isn t much of a difference other than the heat factor 
2009-08|3.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i had terrible frizz and my aunt told me she had some coconut milk anti breakage stuff and that it worked really well so she gave me some and it worked so well i usually shower towel dry my hair then put a few squirts of this in my hair then blow dry i still have a ton of frizz though it just got rid of maybe 1 4 of it
2009-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|love the coconut smell though i wish it was stronger cause i love coconut scents 4oz the texture of this is like a watery syrup it s so loose that its kinds hard to know that you evenly distributed it but i guess i did ok i shampooed then i used about 2 quater sized amounts on my thick mid back lenght wavy hair then i used conditioner this was the only thinged i changed in my hair care routine and i really noticed a difference most products i m like i dont really now i thiiinnkk it s helping but this one i noticed on the first application my hair just felt silker after the the shower and the next morning my hair retained it curls and didnt frizz up after i reapeatly ran my fingers through it i dont use a hair brush which by the way i havent had any split ends to speak of since i ditched the brush about 2 years ago and i really attribute that to my hair being so healthy and i use a microfiber towel i get my hair trimmed about 2x a year so you d think i d have a ton of split ends when i go for a trim but i have none and believe me a few years ago i had horrible hair and would sit and go through the ends myself and cut the split ends hair by hair back to the review so my hair is noticably shinier ran my fingers through really easy feels soft and silky i m looking forward to seeing the results of continous use 
2009-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|this is a miracle in a bottle for anyone who has dry hair that becomes ratty stringy frizzy poufy etc my hair s bipolar incorruptably straight and blah on the underlayer but the top goes past wavy into naturally curly and messy frizzy and generally awful trying to calm my fine dry top layer into something silky smooth and shiny is usually a lost cause this coconut oil was a godsend the very first time i used it you put the product in your hair before you shower then shampoo condition like usual after the shower your hair is silky smooth shiny and soft i let mine air dry and for the first time in my life my curls were beautiful naturally soft to the touch not crunchy dry or frizzy almost completely frizz free and i could still run my hands through my hair without hitting tangles or turning into a pouf head i showered last night and this morning my hair is still silky glossy smooth i put it on when i get out of the gym so it has 15min on my head before i shower and that seems to be enough i m sure people with heavy hair would want to use it less frequently others may want to leave it on longer it s probably ymmv in the way it s used however this product is a miracle don t overlook it seriously also the smell is fantastic i am a huge coconut fan and seriously i love the way it smells it s delicious it washes out to a faint hint which is perfect not overpowering at all 
2009-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|okay i ll start by saying that i detest the matching shampoo conditioner it smells amazing but that s where it ends but i decided to try this anyway for reference i have really thick naturally curly hair that tends to frizz amp dry out i used this for about 10 minutes before washing it out i just covered the ends of my hair with it it did make my hair a bit shinier amp more soft it s a nice boost it smells absolutely mouth watering really nice product give it a try if your hair is on the dry side or you want some extra shine 
2008-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i use this product when i wash my hair after using heat styling tools my hair is in pretty good condition yet this leaves it manageable soft and shiny even if i air dry it smells amazing too i gave it 4 lippies because it s not out of this world amazing but it does work for my hair 
2008-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i had been looking for a good hair oil for a long time being that my scalp has gotten very dry and that it needs to breathe i left this on for about an hour before i used the shampoo and i immediately felt the silkiness that this imparted after the first use i love the shampoo and i wanted to try this product and i am so glad i did my hair is left super shiney soft and silky and it has new life and sheen what i like the most about this is that it doesn t feel heavy on my fine hair and that it doesn t make the hair feel crunchy as many hair oils do wow looooooove this stuff and the fresh coconut scent is heavenly great product indeed 
2008-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i believe this stuff has helped to save my hair i use the nourishing coconut milk anti breakage serum on my hair only a few drops after i shower and i can t believe how healthy my hair has become i ve been using it for about 4 5 weeks now after i have gotten my haired dyed then stripped and my hair has never looked better i have extra body and my hair is starting to re curl which it never does in the cold dry chicago winters the bottle may look small but you only need to use a little bit so i know my original bottle is going to last a long time it is a bit expensive for a drugstore product but i was able to find it at cvs for a buy one organix product get the second free so it ended up being a pretty good deal i also bought the organix nourishing coconut milk self heating coconut oil that is supposed to be applied to dry hair before showering ii don t have much time before showers so i decided to try applying it at night before bed then showering in the morning i don t recommend it the oils get left on your pillow and i ended up breaking out because of it i haven t tried it since because i love the serum and it does such a great job that i m not sure i actually need it 
2008-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i said i would buy again but i don t know i put this on my hair and wrapped it in a bun overnight it had absorbed by morning and my hair was pretty soft i wouldn t say this is a miracle product but i will continue to use it and see what happens the smell is wonderful lingers too 
2007-08|1.0|Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil|i have always heard that coconut oil is a great hair and skin conditioner and i probably could have bought a big jar of it at the grocery for less than what i paid for 4 fl oz of this oh well it smells delicious and comes in a little pump which is nice you are supposed to briskly rub a few drops between your hands and then apply to hair before you shower it doesn t say in the directions but i assume this is before shampooing as well my hair is long and slightly dry at the ends from highlighting but i did not notice much of a difference after using this and i tried a few times with varying amounts my last resort is to really slap it on and wrap a hot towel around my head for an hour i will update if that does any good but for the most part i say save your money get the real thing or just use olive oil smells nice though but if you are washing it out scent is pointless well i was having no luck with this using it in small amounts so i put a ton of it in my hair before bed and slept with it in washing it out at about 10am the next morning it took about 2 latherings to get it all out and my hair was very soft and smooth but static y as all heck afterwards next time i will just slather it on the ends and leave it in all night btw my hair is fine but i have alot of it and i highlight but am letting it grow so it is pretty damaged on the ends this may be better for someone with thicker hair but i still think you would be better off just buying coconut oil at the grocery
2011-08|1.0|Lavender Soymilk Conditioner|my hair is fine and gets greasy by the end of the day i ve been using a shampoo to keep it from getting greasy and was looking for a conditioner to condition hair and keep it from getting dry the first few times i used this conditioner it did nothing at all for my hair and was entirely washed out when i rinsed my hair now i use alot of conditioner and it does manage to condition my hair a little but not enough to justify the price at the same time it does not strengthen my hair and i feel my hair getting finer and weaker by the day am waiting for this to run out so i can try another brand do not buy this product 
2011-08|2.0|Lavender Soymilk Conditioner|you know that lovely silky feeling you get right after you put conditioner in your hair yeah this doesn t do that my hair feels harsh and knotted even while i m rinsing it out i ve been using this along with the passionfruit organix shampoo and my hair is in a pretty sorry state 
2010-08|3.0|Lavender Soymilk Conditioner|i bought both shampoo and conditioner in this range and i was super happy with the results the first few washes not too heavy not too oily also it nourished my daily straightened hair however the more i used it the less clean my hair felt now it feels dry at the ends and the roots are oily and flaky not sure about organix i liked the paraben sulfate free thing but i think i ll need something else to clean my hair with now sad i loved the clean lavender smell 
2010-08|2.0|Lavender Soymilk Conditioner|i ve been using this conditioner for about a month now it smells really nice a light lavender scent that is not overwhelming the color is a light lavender color it s a very thick and creamy conditioner i like that it does not weight my hair down however it does leave my hair tangled unless i comb it out while i have the conditioner still on this would be great if it did not leave my hair tangled 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Instant Repair Treatment|omg i think i am in love with this i purchased two kinds of a renewing repairing kind a treatment from rite aid i purchased organix coconut milk instant repair treatment and organix moroccan argan oil intense moisturizing treatment not yet used lt br gt lt br gt i will definitely compare the two in an updated post on both reviews when it is time lt br gt lt br gt the review this is very similar to a conditioner it works well but i didn t expect much anyway from this product my hair is not damaged dry brittle dyed i have very healthy hair i did notice a slight difference though my hair looks more shiny and healthier like i just got a hair cut type of look i don t like the packaging due to the fact i have to dig out the product with my hands lt br gt lt br gt will i repurchase yes i would and i recommend this lt br gt lt br gt please keep in mind people who read this review these are my opinions and they may differ from you all in all if you really want something go try it especially when it comes to beauty 
2011-08|5.0|Coconut Milk Instant Repair Treatment|i had previously tried the every day conditioner from this line and found it to be very strengthening to my hair but not moisturizing after a few days my hair would start to turn crunchy from all the protein in it i decided what i really needed was a weekly treatment with coconut oil in it so i decided to try the instant repair treatment i am really impressed with it my hair came out soft shiny and with no sign of split ends the results lasted a few days which is pretty much what i was expecting and of course it smells divine the coconut scent from this line is my favorite of all the coconut scented conditioners i ve tried and i ve tried a bunch i will definitely be getting more of this 
2011-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Instant Repair Treatment|i didn t see a difference good or bad with this product it smelled really nice but that s where it ends the tub is awkward and the product is so thick it s hard to get into the hair i put it on while i shaved my legs in the shower and maybe i should have left it in longer i see someone left it in for 2 hours wow but i want something that i can do quickly would not recommend and would not rebuy 
2010-08|4.0|Coconut Milk Instant Repair Treatment|when i bought this product i thought it was going to be an okay deep conditioner i put it on for longer than the recommended time 2 hours and my hair was so soft it was moisturized and smooth combined with the organix nourishing self heating oil my hair is so silky this is my favorite line of organix 
2010-08|2.0|Coconut Milk Instant Repair Treatment|i ve never been so excited about a line the coconut milk smells absolutely gorgeous i actually don t like this particular product but i am also using the leave in nourishing milk which i love and i am about to buy the split ends mender pros really nice sweet coconut smell unfortunately it doesn t last which i expected it to cons very thick pastey consistency hard to scoop out of the tub and very hard to distribute through hair doesn t run through smoothly like a regular conditioner and when i wash it off my hair feels coarse and i need to use my normal conditioner to untangle my hair didn t notice a significant difference in my hair i recommend getting the other products in this line though not the shampoo conditioner price 4 18 aud packaging 4 repurchase no 
2011-08|4.0|cucumber yogurt conditioner|i personally like this product i use it along with the brand s grapefruit mango butter shampoo and the combination leaves my hair soft and shiny my hair seems to fall out less when dry than it did with my last shampoo that was made with a lot of chemicals and sulfates it wasn t too extraordinarily expensive 6 99 at my local rite aid and i love the fact that it s organic and not tested on animals 
2010-08|1.0|cucumber yogurt conditioner|packaging smell amp the concept of organic makes this product sooo appealing after trying it this thing sucks my hair hated it it didnt do anything for it i might as well have used body wash on my hair amp it would have the same results 
2009-08|2.0|cucumber yogurt conditioner|i bought this conditioner along with another organix shampoo passion fruit guava and i was pretty excited to have this whole quot organic quot hair care experience the smells of the products were true to name and they were pretty decent smelling but all the hype on the bottle not so great the products didn t really didn t do anything for my hair nothing a cheaper brand couldn t do especially lacking in the smoothing hydrating department i haven t ruled out the organix hair treatments but i really wouldn t reccomend this conditioner or the shampoo i used but to each his own 
2009-08|2.0|cucumber yogurt conditioner|pros cute packaging alot of natural ingredients cons does not do what it says it does my hair was left dry frizzy and with lots of fly aways too expensive for such a small bottle don t get lured because the bottle has such great things written on it 
2011-08|5.0|Keratin|this really works on hair breakage my hair is thick and can be very rebellious especially in humidity i use this after shampoo and wait for 3 to 5 minutes my hair looks and feels much healthier i use a curling iron and occassionally deal with hair breakage but this has stopped it for good recommended after coloring your hair and if you have any hair breakage issues 
2011-08|3.0|Vanilla Silk Blow Dry Cream|i m not really super sold on this because i have to use a lot of it to smooth my hair it might be my lack of blow drying skills but i use a lot of this when i m blowing out my hair and it s only shoulder length my hair still needs a flat iron after i dry it and it feels a little dry if i use it without mixing in any other product lately i ve been mixing it with some of the argan oil from another line of theirs and i really like the way that s been working the smell is great stays in my hair and lasts into the next day if i blow my hair out at night i ll use the rest of the bottle that i have but probably try something else in the organix line next for blow outs 
2007-08|4.0|Vanilla Silk Blow Dry Cream|another deliciously scented product from organix at a great price this comes in a pump bottle and the consistency is a medium cream not too heavy not too light and not too greasy feeling oh and it smells like vanilla cake frosting my hair is fine but fuzzy amp dry at the ends this helps to calm my hair down but not weight it down or make me break out which other creams can do great price good product and yum yum yummmmmy scent if you enjoy vanilla 
2010-08|3.0|Grapefruit Mango Butter Shampoo|this shampoo claims to moisturize instead it makes my hair feel really dry but i like that it s gentle on my scalp my scalp flakes badly when i use sulfate shampoos during the colder months and so i m using this shampoo to tide me over until spring summer comes along when i can use my regular shampoos again i still flake but not as bad it makes my hair feel a little weighed down but like i said i m using this temporarily smells amazing in the shower but the scent doesn t linger too long after washing it s affordable for a sulfate free shampoo if you re into all that rage the conditioner that accompanies it doesn t do anything for your hair i have to use my regular conditioner to comb through the tangles this shampoo leaves me with i can see that you d definitely need a clarifying shampoo every few weeks or so over all i like this shampoo but i won t repurchase once i m done using it 
2010-08|4.0|Grapefruit Mango Butter Shampoo|i love the scent it smells like the rainbow snowcones you bought from and ice cream truck when you were a kid i feel like it moisturized my hair well too bad the scent doesnt stay in your hair once you blowdry your hair 
2010-08|1.0|Grapefruit Mango Butter Shampoo|i used this shampoo amp conditioner for the very first time today amp i won t be using them again i m not one to leave a negative review on a product but seriously hands down this rates as one of the worst i ve ever tried i bought this thinking this would be really moisturizing amp that is advertised i have long curly dry hair that needs moisture the shampoo had no lather whatsoever amp i used a decent amount since my hair is long it rinsed cleanly out of my hair leaving my hair feeling really stripped so i thought well let s not jump to conclusions let s try the conditioner no luck after using this my hair feels like straw amp a complete matted up mess i wouldn t recommend this for anyone thought about keeping it for a body wash but with no later it s pointless this turned out to be a big miss for me see my review of the conditioner 
2010-08|3.0|Grapefruit Mango Butter Shampoo|i bought this on a whim because it was a buy one get one free deal at my local rite aid i needed to buy new shampoo and conditioner to replace my aubrey organics i wasn t looking for an organic shampoo but something cheap and from a drugstore because i am having an out of money experience i smelled all the shampoo s on the shelve it was between the passionfruit grava and this one and i chose this one because it smelled really good the smell definately dissapears after you wash even if you use it with the same conditioner overall it is an ok shampoo nothing special foams pretty good but it is definately average i have to say it reminds me of those v05 shampoo s that i think are no longer that and suave definately reminds of something like that 
2010-08|1.0|Grapefruit Mango Butter Conditioner|i used this conditioner along with the shampoo for the very first time today never again these have got to be some of the worst i ve ever tried they completely stripped my hair of all moisture leaving my hair a matted mess the only slight plus side was the grapefruit smell but even that was overpowering these both turned out to be a huge miss for me i wouldn t recommend these products to anyone see my review of the shampoo 
2010-08|1.0|Grapefruit Mango Butter Conditioner|like i said in my shampoo review i bought this because of the buy one get one free deal at my riteaid this conditioner really sounded appealing after reading the back label about how moisturizing it is and after i smelled it i was sold too bad it didn t perform i was expecting a nice rich thick conditioner that conditioned my badly damaged hair sadly it didn t it actually made my hair feel like straw it didn t smooth it down or nourish it in anyway i was really lured by the scent it is so delicious smelling but i rather condition my hair in something that smells worse and works great rather than the opposite this product reminds me of those v05 conditioners that they used to sell not sure if they still sell that brand somewhere but i remember seeing them on the shelves for like 80 cents or 99 cents a piece at walmart they definately performed cheap although this brand has organic ingredients and is supposedly natural it is pretty bad aubrey organics definately out performs this by a long shot will not repurchase 
2010-08|1.0|Vanilla Silk|not to be mean but this stuff blows i first found it on clearance at raley s for like 3 or 4 bucks and decided to try it because the scent was heavenly however i took it home and used it with the matching shampoo and was thoroughly disappointed while it did make my hair smell nice it has no conditioning qualities i have really fine hair and it seemed to absorb moisture from anything i have mild to moderate success with almost any shampoo conditioner i use but this one sucked my hair felt like straw afterward when i straightened it it looked all see through and pale and not bouncy or shiny at all ew this is going under my sink maybe i ll use the shampoo to shave my legs i gave it one star for the smell the smell is fabulous 
2010-08|1.0|Vanilla Silk|organix shampoos and conditioners were such a big disappointment for me i have used 3 different ones you think i d have learned my lesson after the first and they were all really terrible on my hair the reason for me is the conditioners are just not conditioning at all with the conditioner on my hair i couldn t get the comb through my hair it just seems they have no detangling or moisturising properties at all these products smell absolutely amazing and lure you in but i would not recommend any of them for people who like moist slippery conditioners that comb through well and leave the hair actually conditioned when dry i give this 1 lippie just for the smell alone 
2009-08|2.0|Vanilla Silk|i wasn t happy with this conditioner after my hg was reformulated aussie 3 minute miracle i tried this one it smelled amazing but unfortunately did not live up to my expectations sure it smelled awesome in the bottle but it left no fragrance at all on my hair if that were the only issue i could live with it but unfortunately it didn t do anything for my hair at all it was dry and frizzy as ever i have curly and somewhat dry hair and the cap is curved so i can t flip it over to get all the product out alone i have to lean it against something and it keeps flipping over i will be using this to shave to use it up i m going to try redken smooth down next 
2008-08|2.0|Vanilla Silk|generally the appeal of organic conditioners is that they don t contain silicones which snap my baby fine hair like a twig sadly this product does contain silicones and does nothing for my easily tangled hair i ve learned when using avalon conditioners that with organic products you need to leave it on longer in order for it to work i left it on for probably 10 minutes and my hair was still a tangled snarly mess i ve been using my leftovers to shave my legs as that seems to be the best use of it as far as price it s cheap for an organic conditioner and i ve learned that you get what you pay for apparently 
2008-08|5.0|Vanilla Silk|i liked the coconut series so i decided to give the vanilla a whirl i m glad i did i love the smell and it works really really well you do need to leave it in for the 3 5 mins they recommend if you aren t getting a good result try following the directions don t expect this to work instantly like a lot of them do it needs to sit so that the oils and proteins have a moment to sink into your hair that said it makes my hair pretty easy to brush through and leaves it super soft and shiny like silk it also leaves me totally frizz free even on rainy days i ve gotten tons of compliments on my hair while using organix both versions i love this stuff and for the price it can t be beaten i used to use biolage which i also love but this is just as good and much cheaper it also has less weird ingredients than 99 of the stuff on the market 
2008-08|1.0|Vanilla Silk|i bought this conditioner while staying with family and four of us tried it none of us were impressed i can t believe they are charging 7 for this stuff other than smelling good it has no benefit and even suave at a much cheaper price works better one of my cousins rarely even needs to use conditioner and she felt this was not conditioning at all my sister and other cousin have normal hair and they felt like it did nothing for their hair i have coarse dry hair and this did not condition or help with tangles at all it was useless for all of us 
2008-08|4.0|Vanilla Silk|i bought this conditioner b c it had a mail in full rebate so i though why not it is pretty good definitely smells good i may buy it again but it is a little expensive for what it does i would say its quality is comparable to that of some less expensive brands its conditioning doesn t stand out to me but i do like the scent a lot 
2008-08|4.0|Vanilla Silk|this is the first product i bought after i went blond and i really like it before i started using this i couldn t even comb through my hair it makes your hair really soft and healthy feeling i love the smell of it too
